C. are one of England’s most prestigious and successful clubs with a long, colourful and fascinating history. From humble beginnings in 1886 to their current status as one of the most iconic clubs in the world, Arsenal has achieved numerous milestones and experienced periods of remarkable success. Arsenal made league history in 2003–04 when they became the first team in a 38-game season to go unbeaten.[8] In the 2000s, Arsenal were finalists in both the UEFA Cup and UEFA Champions League,[9] and have since equalled Real Madrid's record for most consecutive seasons in the latter competition.[10]    As of the end of the 2022–23 season, the club's first team have spent 106 seasons in the top division of English football, and 13 in the second.

The Arsenal Golden Years: 1966 to the Present    From the mid-1960s onwards, Arsenal experienced an era of triumph and transformation, with visionary managers leading the club to remarkable milestones. Arsenal Football Club was founded in 1886 as a munition workers' team from Woolwich, then in Kent. The club was formed in Woolwich in 1886 as Dial Square before it was shortly renamed to Royal Arsenal, and then Woolwich Arsenal in 1893.[1] They became the first southern member[a] admitted into the Football League in 1893, having spent their first four seasons solely participating in cup tournaments and friendlies.[4] The club's name was shortened to Arsenal in 1914, a year after moving to Highbury.[5] In spite of finishing fifth in the Second Division in 1915, Arsenal rejoined the First Division at the expense of local rivals Tottenham Hotspur when football resumed after the First World War.[6] Since that time, they have not fallen below the first tier of the English football league system and hold the record for the longest uninterrupted time in the top flight.[7]    In the 1930s, Arsenal were the dominant side of England, winning five league championships and two FA Cups. Club history    Arsenal Football Club have a storied history as one of England’s most successful teams.

However, after nearly a century at Highbury, Arsenal looked to the future and embarked on a new chapter in their history with a move to the state-of-the-art Emirates Stadium in 2006. Arsenal continued to play their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in the 1894–95\n",
