  The 2020–21 season was Chelsea's 107th competitive season, 32nd consecutive season in the top flight of English football, 29th consecutive season in the Premier League, and 115th year in existence as a football club.[1] The season covered the period from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021.  
  Prior to the 2020–21 season, Chelsea made numerous high-profile signings in the transfer market, bringing in the likes of Timo Werner, Kai Havertz, Ben Chilwell, Hakim Ziyech, and Thiago Silva in the off-season, as well as Édouard Mendy shortly after the season began. The Blues began this season under the management of former Chelsea player Frank Lampard, in his second season at the club. However, Lampard was sacked in January and replaced by German manager Thomas Tuchel, who guided the club to European glory, as on 29 May, Chelsea defeated fellow English side Manchester City in the Champions League final, their second title in the competition, and their first since 2012.  
  Chelsea played their first game of the new Premier League season on 14 September 2020, travelling to Brighton & Hove Albion and earning a 3–1 away victory, courtesy of goals from Jorginho, Kurt Zouma and Reece James.[2] On 20 September, Chelsea welcomed defending champions Liverpool to Stamford Bridge. Andreas Christensen was dismissed in the first half after a naive challenge on Sadio Mané, who then proceeded to score two goals inside four minutes for Liverpool, with goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga making a crucial mistake for Mané's second goal. New signing Timo Werner managed to win a penalty for Chelsea, but Jorginho had his effort saved by Alisson, his first penalty miss in nine attempts, as the match ended in a 2–0 defeat for Chelsea.[3]  
  Three days later, Chelsea faced Barnsley in the EFL Cup, which ended in a 6–0 win for Chelsea, with Kai Havertz scoring a hat-trick for the Blues.[4] Chelsea then travelled to The Hawthorns to play West Bromwich Albion. Chelsea were 3–0 down at half-time, but goals from Mason Mount, Callum Hudson-Odoi, and Tammy Abraham in stoppage-time managed to seal a draw as the match ended 3–3.[5] On 29 September, Chelsea took on London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the round of 16 in the EFL Cup. Timo Werner scored his first Chelsea goal to put the Blues ahead, but Erik Lamela managed to equalise in the second half. Chelsea would go on to lose 5–4 on penalties, with Mason Mount missing the decisive penalty and Chelsea finding themselves eliminated from the EFL Cup.[6]  
  Chelsea's first match of October was against Crystal Palace at home. After no goals in the first half, Chelsea managed to win 4–0, as Ben Chilwell registered a goal and an assist on his Premier League debut for Chelsea.[9] Two weeks later, on 17 October, Chelsea welcomed Southampton to Stamford Bridge. Timo Werner scored his first Premier League goals for Chelsea as the Blues were leading 2–0 inside 28 minutes, with Danny Ings managing to pull a goal back for the Saints before half-time. Che Adams scored an equaliser for Southampton 57 minutes in, but Chelsea instantly responded with a Kai Havertz goal two minutes later, his first in the Premier League. Chelsea were pegged back again in the 92nd minute, with Jannik Vestergaard levelling the game, as Chelsea managed to come out of the game with a frustrating 3–3 draw.[10] In their next two games, Chelsea drew back-to-back games 0–0, first against Sevilla at home in their first Champions League group stage game of the season, and then again away at Manchester United in the Premier League.[11][12]  
  Chelsea then defeated Krasnodar 4–0 away in the Champions League, with Callum Hudson-Odoi, Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech, and Christian Pulisic all on target for the Blues.[13] In Chelsea's final game of the month on 31 October, they defeated Burnley 3–0 away, with Hakim Ziyech scoring and assisting on his first Premier League start, with additional goals from Kurt Zouma and Timo Werner sealing the win for Chelsea.[14]  
  Chelsea begun November with a 3–0 home victory over Rennes in the Champions League, with the goals coming from two Timo Werner penalties and a Tammy Abraham strike.[19] Three days later, in Chelsea's last match before the November international break, Chelsea faced bottom of the league Sheffield United at home, who had lost seven out of their first eight Premier League games this season. The match ended in a comfortable 4–1 win for the Blues, which saw Hakim Ziyech pick up two assists.[20]  
  After the international break, Chelsea returned on 21 November to face Newcastle United at St James' Park. Chelsea ran out 2–0 winners, with a Federico Fernández own goal and a goal from Tammy Abraham sealing the win for Chelsea, marking the first time Chelsea were top of the Premier League under Frank Lampard.[21] Chelsea won their sixth consecutive game in a row in their next match against Rennes in the Champions League, which saw Callum Hudson-Odoi and Olivier Giroud on the scoresheet in a 2–1 away victory, sealing qualification for the Champions League round of 16.[22] Chelsea next had inform London rivals Tottenham Hotspur to play at Stamford Bridge, who had already eliminated Chelsea from the EFL Cup back in September. The match ended in goalless 0–0 draw, which saw Tottenham ascend to the top of the league.[23]  
  Ben Chilwell's performances throughout November earned a nomination for the Premier League Player of the Month award, which was by Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes, and Frank Lampard's managerial duties saw him nominated for Premier League Manager of the Month, which was instead by Tottenham Hotspur's José Mourinho.[24][25][26][27]  
  Chelsea's first game of the busy December period was at Sevilla in the Champions League group stage. Frank Lampard's Blues ran out 4–0 winners, with Olivier Giroud scoring all four goals for Chelsea, ensuring that the Blues' top spot in their group was secured.[28] On December 5, they welcomed bitter rivals Leeds United to Stamford Bridge, in Chelsea's first home game with 2,000 fans in attendance. Leeds took a shock lead just five minutes through Patrick Bamford, but the Blues managed to equalise with an Olivier Giroud goal and defeated their rivals 3–1 to go top of the Premier League, with Kurt Zouma and Christian Pulisic also adding to the goals.[29] Chelsea played out a 1–1 home draw three days later against Krasnodar, in their final group stage game of the Champions League.[30]  
  Next, Chelsea travelled to Goodison Park to play Everton on 12 December. The match ended in a 1–0 loss for Chelsea, their first away defeat of the season, putting an end to their 17-game unbeaten run and losing ground in the title race, with Tottenham and Liverpool both ahead of Chelsea, and with a game in hand.[31] Chelsea then followed this up by losing again away to Wolverhampton Wanderers, with a 95th minute winner from Pedro Neto sealing a 2–1 win for Wolves.[32] Chelsea returned to winning ways in a 3–0 home victory against West Ham United, with a header from Thiago Silva and a brace from Tammy Abraham sealing an emphatic victory.[33]  
  On 26 December, Chelsea travelled to North London to play out-of-form Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium; Arsenal were in 15th place and were winless in the last seven matches entering this game. The Gunners took a shock 2–0 lead at half-time, courtesy of an Alexandre Lacazette penalty and a Granit Xhaka free kick, before Bukayo Saka added to Arsenal's shock lead in the 56th minute. Tammy Abraham scored a consolation goal in the 85th minute, and Jorginho had a penalty saved in added time by Bernd Leno, to ensure no comeback was to happen for the Blues, in an humiliating 3–1 defeat.[34] Chelsea closed out 2020 with a 1–1 home draw against Aston Villa, with Olivier Giroud and Anwar El Ghazi scoring the only goals of the game.[35]  
  Chelsea's first match of 2021 was at home against Manchester City on 3 January. Chelsea struggled greatly throughout the game and were 3–0 down inside 34 minutes, with the goals coming from İlkay Gündoğan, Phil Foden, and former Chelsea man Kevin De Bruyne. Callum Hudson-Odoi scored a consolation goal in the 92nd minute, as the Blues suffered another embarrassing 3–1 defeat.[36] The next week, Chelsea begun their quest for the FA Cup after coming up short the previous year, starting off their journey with a comfortable 4–0 home victory against League Two side Morecambe in the third round, with Mason Mount, Timo Werner, Callum Hudson-Odoi, and Kai Havertz finding the net for Chelsea.[37]  
  Chelsea then made a trip to Craven Cottage to take on West London rivals Fulham. The game saw Fulham fullback Antonee Robinson being shown a red card after a dangerous challenge César Azpilicueta. Mason Mount managed to score the only goal of the match in the 78th minute, as Chelsea earned a hard-fought 1–0 win against their rivals.[38] Chelsea's next match was away at high-flying Leicester City, who at this point were second in the league. Chelsea went on to lose this match 2–0, with first-half goals from Wilfred Ndidi and James Maddison piling more misery on the Blues' bad run of form.[39] Frank Lampard's final game took place on 24 January, as Chelsea defeated Luton Town 3–1 in the FA Cup. However, this wasn't enough to save Lampard's job, as the very next day, Chelsea announced the sacking of Lampard after their poor run of form that included only two wins from their past eight league matches.[40]  
  The following day, it was announced that former Borussia Dortmund and Paris Saint-Germain manager Thomas Tuchel would be replacing Lampard as the manager of Chelsea.[41] Tuchel's first match in charge took place two days later, with Chelsea taking on Wolverhampton Wanderers at Stamford Bridge. The match ended in a frustrating 0–0 stalemate, with Chelsea having 79% possession of the ball but were unable to find the net. Tuchel stated after the match that "we will build a team nobody wants to play against".[42] Chelsea's final match of the month was against Burnley at home, which saw Tuchel claim his first win as Chelsea manager, as goals from César Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso sealed a 2–0 victory for the Blues.[43] Alonso's strike against the Clarets earned him a nomination for the Premier League Goal of the Month award, eventually won by Liverpool's Mohamed Salah.[44][45]  
  Chelsea opened February with three consecutive away victories at Tottenham Hotspur and Sheffield United in the league, and Barnsley in the FA Cup.[46][47][48] On 15 February, Chelsea welcomed Newcastle United to Stamford Bridge, with Chelsea winning 2–0 to claim their fifth victory in a row in all competitions, as Timo Werner ended his 14-game goal drought in the Premier League, dating back to November.[49]  
  Chelsea then took the trip to St Mary's Stadium to take on Southampton on 20 February, who had lost their last six Premier League matches in a row, including a 9–0 defeat at Manchester United. The Blues could only manage a 1–1 draw, with Takumi Minamino opening the scoring in the first half before Mason Mount equalised with a penalty in the second half.[50] Three days later, Chelsea travelled to Spain to play Atlético Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League round of 16 tie. Chelsea won the match 1–0, with an Olivier Giroud bicycle kick sealing the first leg win and a crucial away goal for Chelsea.[51] Chelsea returned to Premier League action on 28 February, playing out a dull goalless stalemate against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge.[52]  
  Chelsea's league performances under Thomas Tuchel in February earned the German a nomination for the Premier League Manager of the Month award, which was won by Manchester City's Pep Guardiola.[53][54]  
  Chelsea's first match of the month saw them take on Liverpool at Anfield, who had lost their last four home games after going on a 68-game home unbeaten run between April 2017 and January 2021, the second-longest in league history, with the record belonging to Chelsea themselves after going unbeaten at home for 86 games between March 2004 and October 2008. Chelsea defeated the Reds 1–0, with a superb Mason Mount strike in the 42nd minute condemning Liverpool to their fifth home loss in a row, and Tuchel extending his unbeaten run to 10 games.[55] Next, Chelsea defeated Everton 2–0, with an own goal form Ben Godfrey and a Jorginho penalty sealing the victory for the Blues.[56]  
  The Blues then travelled to Elland Road to play bitter rivals Leeds United on 13 March, which ended in a 0–0 draw.[57] Chelsea then played the second leg of their Champions League round of 16 tie against Atlético Madrid, this time at home, with the Blues heading into the game with a 1–0 advantage and a away goal. Chelsea earned a 2–0 victory, with goals from Hakim Ziyech and Emerson Palmieri ensuring Chelsea's progression to the quarter finals of the Champions League, the first time they had done so since the 2013–14 season.[58] The victory also meant that Tuchel became the first Chelsea manager to go unbeaten in his first 13 matches in charge of the club, surpassing the previous record of 12 held by Luiz Felipe Scolari.[59] Chelsea followed this up by defeating Sheffield United in the quarter finals of the FA Cup, sending the Blues through to the semi-finals.[60] Chelsea then went on a brief hiatus for the March international break.  
  Chelsea were nominated for all three Premier League awards in March, with Andreas Christensen's defensive performances earning him a nomination for the Premier League Player of the Month award, and Mason Mount's goal against Liverpool also being nominated for Premier League Goal of the Month.[61][62] Thomas Tuchel was nominated for the Premier League Manager of the Month award for the second consecutive month, this time being honoured with the award.[63]  
  Chelsea's first match after the international break saw them welcome relegation-fighting West Bromwich Albion to Stamford Bridge. Christian Pulisic gave Chelsea the lead 27 minutes in but just two minutes later, Thiago Silva was sent off after receiving a second yellow card. The Blues found themselves 2–1 down at half-time via a stoppage-time brace from Matheus Pereira. Goals from Callum Robinson and Mbaye Diagne gave the Baggies a shocking 4–1 lead. Mason Mount managed to pull one back for Chelsea, but another goal from Callum Robinson in added time capped off an embarrassing 2–5 defeat for Chelsea, ending Thomas Tuchel's 14-game unbeaten streak as manager. It was the first time Chelsea had conceded 5 goals at home since a 3–5 defeat against Arsenal in 2011, and was also the first time they had lost to West Bromwich Albion at Stamford Bridge since 1978.[64] Chelsea bounced back from the humiliation in their next game, which was the first leg of their Champions League quarter final tie against Porto away, which saw a fine Mason Mount strike and a late Ben Chilwell goal give Chelsea a 2–0 victory with two crucial away goals.[65]  
  Chelsea then travelled to South London to take on Crystal Palace away on 10 April. Goals from Kai Havertz, Kurt Zouma and a brace from Christian Pulisic saw Chelsea run out 4–1 winners, the first time they had scored more than two goals under Tuchel.[66] The Blues then played Porto in the second leg of the Champions League quarter finals, heading into the game with a 2–0 advantage and two away goals. Chelsea were defeated 1–0 thanks to a late Mehdi Taremi overhead kick, but did enough to make it through to the Champions League semi-finals, winning 2–1 on aggregate.[67] Four days later, Chelsea defeated Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-finals, with Hakim Ziyech scoring the winner to help Chelsea advance to the FA Cup Final for the second consecutive year.[68]  
  On 18 April, it was announced that Chelsea would be a founding member of the newly formed European Super League, a proposed annual club football competition to be contested by twenty of Europe's most elite football clubs.[69] On 20 April, after two days of widespread backlash from the United Kingdom government including Prime Minister Boris Johnson, FIFA, UEFA, the FA, other Premier League clubs, supporters, players, and broadcasters, and after Chairman Bruce Buck met with players, Chelsea announced their intention to withdraw from the competition.[70] This led to the five other English clubs all pulling out later that night.[71] By 21 April, the Super League announced it was suspending its operations.[72]  
  On 20 April, Chelsea played out a 0–0 home draw against Brighton & Hove Albion, losing some ground in the top four race.[73] Four days later, the Blues defeated West Ham United 1–0 away, with a Timo Werner goal sealing the win for Chelsea. Chelsea's final match of April was against Real Madrid away in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals. Chelsea took the lead through Christian Pulisic, but Karim Benzema equalised for Real Madrid later in the first half, as the match ended in a 1–1 draw, with Chelsea entering the second leg at home a crucial away goal.[74]  
  Chelsea's first fixture of May saw them defeat West London rivals Fulham 2–0, thanks to a brace from Kai Havertz.[75] On 5 May, Chelsea welcomed Real Madrid to Stamford Bridge for the second leg of their semi-final, with the score being level at 1–1 and Chelsea heading into the match with an away goal. Timo Werner gave Chelsea the lead in the 28th minute, before a late tap-in from Mason Mount booked Chelsea their place in the Champions League Final in Istanbul.[76] Their win set up an all-English affair after Manchester City had secured their maiden appearance in the final the day before, defeating Paris Saint-Germain over two legs.[77]  
  Chelsea's next match in the Premier League was against their Champions League final opponents, Manchester City, at the Etihad Stadium. Raheem Sterling scored first for the Citizens 44 minutes in, with Sergio Agüero having a penalty saved by Édouard Mendy just before half-time. Hakim Ziyech scored the equaliser for the Blues in the 63rd minute, before a stoppage-time goal from Marcos Alonso saw Chelsea run out 2–1 winners, as Thomas Tuchel made it two consecutive victories against Pep Guardiola.[78] Next, Chelsea took on ninth-placed Arsenal at home, with Mikel Arteta's Gunners already enduring a poor season. Chelsea were shockingly defeated 1–0, with a poor back pass from Jorginho allowing Emile Smith Rowe to score the winner for Arsenal, with Christian Pulisic also having a goal disallowed by VAR due to a handball. This was the first time had Chelsea had lost to Arsenal at home in nearly a decade, since a 3–5 defeat in October 2011.[79]  
  On 15 May, Chelsea faced Leicester City in the FA Cup Final, which was Chelsea's first chance of winning silverware this season. It was a frustrating game for Tuchel's Blues, as they were denied by Kasper Schmeichel multiple times throughout the game, with a Youri Tielemans stunner in the 63rd minute putting Leicester 1–0 up. Chelsea thought they had found their equaliser through Ben Chilwell in the 88th minute, but was ruled out by VAR for offside, as the Foxes won their first ever FA Cup and Chelsea had lost the FA Cup Final for the second straight year.[80] Chelsea had an immediate rematch against Leicester City three days later in the Premier League, with goals from Antonio Rüdiger and Jorginho giving Chelsea a 2–1 victory and strengthening their top four hopes, while leaving Leicester's Champions League hopes in danger.[81] Chelsea's final Premier League match of the season saw them travel to Birmingham to face Aston Villa, on 23 May. Chelsea would go on to lose 2–1, but still finished fourth and secured their place in next season's Champions League, as elsewhere, Leicester City lost to Tottenham Hotspur.[82]  
  On 29 May, Chelsea faced Manchester City in the Champions League Final. It was the third time in Chelsea's 116-year history that they had competed in the Champions League final, losing against Manchester United in 2008 and defeating Bayern Munich in 2012. Chelsea went into the match as the underdogs, similarly to 2012, and defeated Manchester City 1–0 to win the Champions League, with Kai Havertz's goal in the first-half goal sealing Chelsea's second Champions League title. Chelsea became the third English club to win the Champions League multiple times, after Liverpool (2005, 2019) and Manchester United (1999, 2008).[83]

  Chelsea got the right to enter the 2020–21 FA Cup in the third round proper along with the other Premier League and Championship clubs. The third round draw was made on 30 November, and Chelsea were drawn against League Two side Morecambe.[197] The draw for the fourth and fifth round were made on 11 January, conducted by Peter Crouch.[198] In the fourth round, Chelsea overcame Championship club Luton Town by a score of 3–1, with Tammy Abraham scoring all three goals for his side. In doing so, Abraham became the first Englishman to a score a hat-trick for Chelsea in the FA Cup since manager Frank Lampard in 2007, and he became the first Chelsea youth team product to score ten or more goals in back-to-back seasons since Mike Fillery in 1982–83.[199] The match against Luton Town was Lampard's last in charge as he was sacked the following day.[41] The draw for the quarter-finals was made, live on BT Sport by Karen Carney on 11 February.[200] The draw for the semi-finals was made, live on BBC One by Dion Dublin on 21 March.[201] Chelsea reached the 2021 FA Cup Final after defeating Manchester City 1–0 in the semi-final with a goal from Hakim Ziyech. However, Chelsea would end up losing the final 1–0 to Leicester City following a controversial goal from Youri Tielemans.[202][203]  
  The draw for both the second and third round were confirmed on September 6, live on Sky Sports by Phil Babb.[204] In the third round, Chelsea were drawn at home against Championship side Barnsley. Tammy Abraham opened the scoring in the 19th minute, slotting past former Blues keeper Brad Collins. New signing, Kai Havertz, then latched on to Mason Mount's pass after a clever Abraham dummy and slid left-footed effort into the bottom corner to open his Chelsea account.[205] Ross Barkley made it three after the break before Abraham's neat flick teed Havertz up for a simple finish inside the area. Abraham then found Havertz for his hat-trick goal in the 65th minute and Olivier Giroud finished the scoring to make it 6–0 with seven minutes to go.[205]  
  The fourth round draw was conducted on 17 September 2020 by Laura Woods and Lee Hendrie live on Sky Sports; Chelsea were handed an away game against Tottenham Hotspur, led by former manager José Mourinho.[206] Chelsea went in front against Spurs with new signing Timo Werner netting his first goal for the club in the 19th minute.[207] However, Erik Lamela would equalize for Tottenham with six minutes to go and the hosts would go on to win in the penalty shoot-out after a solitary miss from Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount.[208]  
  The group stage draw was held on 1 October 2020 with Chelsea being placed in Group E along with Europa League holders Sevilla and two competition debutants in Krasnodar of Russia and Stade Rennes of France.[209] Chelsea progressed as group winners having won four matches and drawing the other two.[210] This included a convincing 4–0 away win versus Sevilla with Olivier Giroud scoring all four. In the draw for the round of 16, Chelsea were pitted against Spanish side Atlético Madrid, setting up the eighth and ninth matches between the clubs in just over a decade, following group stage clashes in 2009–10, a solitary matchup in the 2012 UEFA Super Cup, a semi-final tie in 2013–14, and another group stage meeting in the Champions League in 2017–18.[211] Chelsea would go on to win the first leg 1–0 after a goal from Olivier Giroud. Chelsea moved on to the quarter-finals after a 2–0 second-leg win, with a goal in each half from Hakim Ziyech and Emerson, and were drawn against FC Porto. It was the ninth meeting between the two clubs, the most recent being a 2–0 Chelsea victory in the group stage of the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League.[212] Chelsea defeated Porto 2–0 in the first match.[213] They advanced 2–1 on aggregate despite losing 1–0 in the second leg to Porto. By doing this, Chelsea reached the Semi-finals, a feat they had not accomplished since 2013–14 campaign. Chelsea were drawn against Real Madrid in the Semi-finals. The first leg was played in the Alfredo Di Stéfano. Christian Pulisic gave Chelsea the lead before Karim Benzema equalized for the home side, the match ended in a 1–1 draw. In the second leg at Stamford Bridge, Timo Werner and Mason Mount gave Chelsea a 2–0 win (3–1 on aggregate). This meant that Chelsea would be in the final, the first time Chelsea had reached the final since the 2011–12 campaign. In the final at the Estádio do Dragão, Chelsea would emerge victorious against Manchester City 1–0 with a goal from Kai Havertz sealing their first Champions League title since the 2011–12 campaign.[214]  
  The draw for the semi-finals was held on 19 March 2021, after the quarter-final draw.[218]  
  Note: Real Madrid played their home match at Alfredo Di Stéfano, Madrid, instead of their regular stadium Santiago Bernabéu, Madrid.  
  Note: The final was originally scheduled to be played in Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul. However, on 12 May, UEFA announced it had been moved to Portugal since the high COVID-19 infection rates in Turkey had led the UK government to place travel to Turkey on its red-list, meaning fans would have had to quarantine for ten days in a hotel at their expense on their return. Portugal at the same time was on the green-list which meant no travel restrictions at either end for those attending the final.[220][221]

  Edouard Mendy: How Chelsea goalkeeper became Africa's number one  
  Wherever he goes in Africa, Senegal's Edouard Mendy - the continent's only Premier League goalkeeper - says he is hugely inspired by those he meets.  
  The Chelsea star, 29, has had an unforgettable year since joining in September 2020 on the insistence of the club's legendary former goalkeeper Petr Cech.  
  Now boasting Champions League and Uefa Super Cup medals, Mendy is starting to emulate the Czech's trophy-laden spell with the Blues after a string of largely-flawless performances.  
  "It's incredible because I've made people proud across the continent," he told BBC Sport Africa. "Everywhere in Africa, when I walk in the street, people stop to congratulate me.  
  "It's something exceptional because when you go to South Africa, Congo or Togo, say, you have all these people saying they're proud of you, they're backing you and telling you to continue what you're doing.  
  "That gives me enormous pleasure and makes me want to keep on winning."  
  The latter is something he's getting used to.  
  His debut Champions League season was remarkable - as he lifted the trophy, became the first goalkeeper to keep nine clean sheets (a joint-record) in his first year and was later named Uefa's Goalkeeper of 2020-21. , external  
  Little surprise then that it's his highlight of the year.  
  "It's the most difficult competition in Europe," said the BBC African Sports Personality of the Year nominee.  
  "We were very good in the group stages, knock-out stages and the final. For my first year in the Champions League, it was a good debut."  
  His favourite save of 2021 came in the tournament too, when keeping out Real Madrid's Karim Benzema in the second leg of a semi-final Chelsea won 2-0 to book their place in May's final against Manchester City.  
  In Porto, Mendy became the first African goalkeeper to play a Champions League final, even if Zimbabwe's Bruce Grobbelaar had twice done so in the tournament's forerunner, the European Cup (winning in 1984, but losing in 1985).  
  "It's real pride for me and my family," he said.  
  Grobbelaar and Mendy form precisely half the total tally of African Premier League goalkeepers since its launch in 1992, with Nigeria's Carl Ikeme and Ghanaian Richard Kingson the only others.  
  "I know it's a responsibility and I've always said I'll do my best to make people proud and show there could be lots more African goalkeepers in the Premier League."  
  The man known as 'Edou' at Chelsea is certainly doing that - registering an impressive 36 clean sheets in his first 65 Blues games, and conceding just 42 goals.  
  Cech mate  
  Mendy owes his Premier League chance to Cech, whose own journey from Rennes to Stamford Bridge resulted in one Champions League win and four championships among other triumphs.  
  "Petr pushed hard to recruit me so when I arrived, I really wanted to be the best on the pitch - to show him he had made the best choice," said Mendy.  
  He started as he meant to go on, keeping clean sheets in six of his first seven games, with one of these a goalless draw away to Manchester United - a game he still savours.  
  "I think of the match against Manchester United - one of my first in the Premier League and at Old Trafford, which is well-known in football as being one of the most beautiful places to play."  
  Mendy says he was able to hit the ground running in England because he knew and "loved" the country already, having visited many times previously since his sister lived here.  
  Asked about the biggest changes he had to adapt to, Mendy points to the level of intensity in the English top flight and its packed Christmas schedule.  
  Rags to riches  
  While reflecting on his rise, Mendy - who helped Senegal reach the 2022 World Cup play-offs this year - credits his father and brother for enabling him to overcome serious setbacks.  
  "My dad told me to work hard if I wanted something, while my brother took me to a stadium to practice, so it's my family who've always supported me and pushed me to reach my goals."  
  Although he signed his first professional contract back in 2011 with third-tier side Cherbourg in France, where he grew up, he entered a footballing desert when that deal ended in 2014.  
  Misled by an agent, he spent a year with no club and thus no income, so forcing the then 22-year-old to register with France's unemployment agency as he seriously considered his future.  
  But after a former team-mate recommended Mendy to a friend at Marseille, the Senegalese joined as a fourth-choice goalkeeper before his performances for the reserves found him drawing interest from elsewhere.  
  Mendy chose Ligue 2 side Reims, who he helped win promotion, and after a fine first season in the French top-flight prompted his 2019 move to Rennes, his continued good form found big-spending Chelsea chasing the once cash-strapped Mendy.  
  "My story can symbolise hope for a lot of people, because there are a lot of young players who can find themselves in my situation," he says.  
  "It's a mixture of faith, patience and work - lots of work. You need to believe in yourself, and always work harder than others."  
  Last month, he was also recognised as one of the world's best - finishing runner-up in the Yashin Trophy, which is awarded to Europe's greatest goalkeeper by France Football during the Ballon d'Or gala.  
  "A few years ago, I was unemployed, without a club, and today I find myself named among the world's best goalkeepers. It shows me I'm on the right track, and in the right place to win titles and be the best in the world."

  Chelsea win Club World Cup: Kai Havertz winner sees off Palmeiras after extra time  
  Last updated on 12 February 202212 February 2022.From the section Football2114  
  Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel dedicated his side's first Club World Cup triumph to owner Roman Abramovich after an extra-time win against Brazilian side Palmeiras.  
  A 117th-minute penalty in Abu Dhabi by Kai Havertz - who also scored their 2021 Champions League winner - means the Blues have now won every possible trophy under the ownership of the Russian billionaire  
  Romelu Lukaku opened the scoring with a header in the second half before Raphael Veiga levelled from the spot.  
  Palmeiras defender Luan was sent off in added time as the Blues sealed victory.  
  "It is for him, there is no doubt that it is for him," said Tuchel of Abramovich.  
  "We met quickly on the pitch after the final, he said 'congratulations' and I said 'congratulations, it's for you, it's your club and it's your input and your passion that made this possible' and I'm happy to be part of it.  
  "So of course the trophy is for him."  
  Much like in their semi-final win against Al-Hilal, Chelsea dominated possession but struggled to create chances for much of the final in the United Arab Emirates.  
  Their cutting edge looked unlikely to improve when Mason Mount was forced off through injury, just as he was in their FA Cup tie with Plymouth, while Lukaku continued to cut an isolated figure up front.  
  Palmeiras were content to make the most of their threat on the counter-attack, with the pace of Rony and Dudu stretching the Blues defence, but there were very few clear-cut chances.  
  Then nine minutes after the break, Lukaku made the breakthrough when Callum Hudson-Odoi sent in his first pinpoint cross and the Belgium striker powered a header past Weverton.  
  Christian Pulisic, Mount's replacement, went close with a shot from distance after a smart lay-off from Lukaku as the English side looked to cement their control.  
  But just past the hour mark, Palmeiras equalised when Thiago Silva was adjudged to have handled in the area and, after a check on the pitch-side monitor, Veiga converted emphatically from 12 yards to send the game into extra time.  
  With a penalty shoot-out looming, Chelsea secured the trophy with a spot-kick of their own. Luan's handball was also checked on the monitor before Germany playmaker Havertz fired home.  
  Luan was then dismissed for a foul on the match winner in the final minute, after the referee was told to consult the monitor for a third time.  
  'We were running out of lights'  
  Tuchel says he only beat his Covid isolation at the "second-to-last chance" to coach Chelsea to their maiden Club World Cup title in person.  
  The Blues' German boss was frustrated by having to coach Chelsea in the FA Cup fourth round against Plymouth and the Club World Cup semi-final from his office.  
  And, as time ticked down, he says he made several drives to the airport without even waiting for his Covid test result, such was his desperation to join the Chelsea squad in Abu Dhabi.  
  He tested negative at the penultimate chance to reach the United Arab Emirates in time though.  
  "We were running out of lights, with the time difference we knew the deadline was coming," said Tuchel.  
  "So it was the second-to-last chance to make it, the last one would have been to arrive today in the morning. So I'm happy that we made it.  
  "I was several times on my way to the airport and several times while I was driving called back because my test was not negative.  
  "And finally we made it, I arrived yesterday for dinner, at 8.15 in the evening. Coaching is also about feeling, on the touchline. It's not possible to coach only from the office."

  Very proud of my team, that was assembled with only 32m euros (not enough to buy lukaku's left leg) and was 3 minutes away from a penalty shoot-out against the best team in Europe.  
  Chelsea's defense was absolutely impressive, well deserved world title. We improved from 4th to 2nd this season, maybe if we return we can finally win the title next time.

  Chelsea 2-0 Borussia Dortmund (agg 2-1): Blues fight back to reach last eight  
  By Phil McNultyChief football writer at Stamford Bridge  
  Last updated on 7 March 20237 March 2023.From the section European Football1158  
  Graham Potter enjoyed his finest night as Chelsea manager as they overcame a first-leg deficit against Borussia Dortmund to reach the Champions League quarter-finals.  
  Potter was under huge pressure after a dismal run of results following Chelsea's huge outlay in the transfer market, but he will hope the manner of this performance and the advance into the latter stages of Europe's elite competition will deliver a measure of calm and stability to Stamford Bridge.  
  Chelsea fully deserved their win, although they squandered several big opportunities before Raheem Sterling made the breakthrough after 43 minutes, firing past Dortmund keeper Alexander Meyer after initially fluffing his shot.  
  The goal which settled the tie and overturned Dortmund's 1-0 advantage from the first leg came in contentious fashion from the penalty spot eight minutes after the break.  
  Dortmund were furious when a VAR review penalised Marius Wolf for handball from Ben Chilwell's cross and their sense of injustice heightened after Kai Havertz struck the post with his spot-kick only for a re-take to be ordered.  
  This time Havertz made no mistake and Chelsea were on their way into the last eight.  
  Speaking after the game, Potter said: "The players were tremendous and the supporters were tremendous.  
  "We had to be against a team that were doing so well. Over the two games I felt that we deserved to go through. It was a special night."  
  Is this lift-off for Potter?  
  Potter was been waiting for a show of strength such as this from the moment he left Brighton to take over at Chelsea, succeeding Champions League winner Thomas Tuchel.  
  Potter has struggled to convince Chelsea's fans he has the personality required to take on this occasionally dysfunctional football beast and his cause has not been helped by poor Premier League form and a battle to establish any sort of shape and stability from the influx of players assembled at vast expense by new owner Todd Boehly.  
  The pressure was released somewhat with Saturday's narrow win over Leeds United at Stamford Bridge but a big Champions League win against opponents of such European pedigree as Borussia Dortmund will go some way to convincing the doubters that Potter is cut out for the task.  
  There is still much work to do as Chelsea lie in a wholly unacceptable 10th place in the Premier League and two victories will not change the landscape instantly but there is no doubt Stamford Bridge felt like a much happier place when Dutch referee Danny Makkelie sounded his final whistle.  
  Potter will have been satisfied to see big performances from fit-again Reece James with Ben Chilwell also outstanding. And his former Brighton player Marc Cucurella also looked much more at home than he has before.  
  The scenes at the final whistle were a sharp contrast to many witnessed at Stamford Bridge this season with Potter punching the air in front of joyous Chelsea supporters as their Champions League journey continues.  
  Potter added: "To win a game and go into the last eight of the Champions League, it's up there with one of the games or evenings of my career.  
  "I watched the first penalty and it didn't work so well. I can't do anything. It's down to Kai and his talent and testament and that's at the top level."  
  Subdued Bellingham still shows class  
  All eyes were England teenager Jude Bellingham from the moment he arrived at Stamford Bridge, with waiting Chelsea fans making an instant sales pitch for the young star, who is expected to be pursued by every big club in Europe this summer.  
  This was not Bellingham's best night as Dortmund's Champions League campaign came to an end with the added disappointment of squandering a first-leg lead, but the 19-year-old still showed why he will be in such demand.  
  Bellingham's night had low points, such as when he poked a great chance wide from eight yards in the second half and a very poor challenge in the closing seconds that left Reece James prostrate and brought a yellow card.  
  He did, however, show class and arrogance on the ball, vision, and a marauding style as Dortmund chased an equaliser in vain after Chelsea grabbed control.  
  Bellingham trooped off at the final whistle and is likely to be playing his Champions League football elsewhere next season, but in little flashes he still showed what all the fuss is about.

  Well done Chelsea. I'm a West Ham fan and I have no problem giving credit where it's due or backing other London/English clubs in Euro fixtures. Football is a game and I've never understood the sort of vitriol and hatred some 'fans' exhibit when their team loses. Get over it! Life's too precious and too short to fight about football.

  Per the rules: "if any part of the foot is on the penalty area or arc line it is encroachment. The player must still have a material impact on the outcome of the kick."  
  The player who cleared the ball after it hit the post was one of the ones who encroached so clearly a material outcome. Had a Chelsea player scored the rebound after encroaching it would have been disallowed.

  A number of comments about how harsh the penalty decision was. Almost nothing on Can barging Havertz in the back, just as he was about to shoot, and no penalty awarded, yet ref gave free kicks on several occasions for exactly the same offence elsewhere on the pitch - for both teams.

  Amazon spends $2.75 billion on AI startup Anthropic in its largest venture investment yet  
  Published Wed, Mar 27 202412:50 PM EDTUpdated 1 Min Ago  
  Amazon is spending billions more to back an artificial intelligence startup as it looks for an edge in the new technology arms race.  
  The tech and cloud giant said Wednesday it would spend another $2.75 billion backing Anthropic, adding to its initial $1.25 billion check.  
  It's the latest in a spending blitz by cloud providers to stay ahead in what's viewed as a new technology revolution.  
  Amazon is making its largest outside investment in its three-decade history as it looks to gain an edge in the artificial intelligence race.  
  The tech giant said it will spend another $2.75 billion backing Anthropic, a San Francisco-based startup that's widely viewed as a front-runner in generative artificial intelligence. Its foundation model and chatbot Claude competes with OpenAI and ChatGPT.  
  The companies announced an initial $1.25 billion investment in September, and said at the time that Amazon would invest up to $4 billion. Wednesday's news marks Amazon's second tranche of that funding.  
  Amazon will maintain a minority stake in the company and won't have an Anthropic board seat, the company said. The deal was struck at the AI startup's last valuation, which was $18.4 billion, according to a source.  
  Over the past year, Anthropic closed five different funding deals worth about $7.3 billion. The company's product directly competes with OpenAI's ChatGPT in both the enterprise and consumer worlds, and it was founded by ex-OpenAI research executives and employees.  
  News of the Amazon investment comes weeks after Anthropic debuted Claude 3, its newest suite of AI models that it says are its fastest and most powerful yet. The company said the most capable of its new models outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini Ultra on industry benchmark tests, such as undergraduate level knowledge, graduate level reasoning and basic mathematics.  
  "Generative AI is poised to be the most transformational technology of our time, and we believe our strategic collaboration with Anthropic will further improve our customers' experiences, and look forward to what's next," said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of data and AI at AWS cloud provider.  
  Amazon's move is the latest in a spending blitz among cloud providers to stay ahead in the AI race. And it's the second update in a week to Anthropic's capital structure. Late Friday, bankruptcy filings showed crypto exchange FTX struck a deal with a group of buyers to sell the majority of its stake in Anthropic, confirming a CNBC report from last week.

  What is generative AI?  
  The term generative AI entered the mainstream and business vernacular seemingly overnight, and the field has exploded over the past year, with a record $29.1 billion invested across nearly 700 deals in 2023, according to PitchBook. OpenAI's ChatGPT first showcased the tech's ability to produce human-like language and creative content in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has said more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted the platform, spanning industries such as financial services, legal applications and education.  
  Cloud providers like Amazon Web Services don't want to be caught flat-footed.  
  It's a symbiotic relationship. As part of the agreement, Anthropic said it will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. It will also use Amazon chips to train, build and deploy its foundation models. Amazon has been designing its own chips that may eventually compete with Nvidia.  
  Microsoft has been on its own spending spree with a high-profile investment in OpenAI. Microsoft's OpenAI bet has reportedly jumped to $13 billion as the startup's valuation has topped $29 billion. Microsoft's Azure is also OpenAI's exclusive provider for computing power, which means the startup's success and new business flows back to Microsoft's cloud servers.  
  Google, meanwhile, has also backed Anthropic, with its own deal for Google Cloud. It agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic, comprising a $500 million cash infusion, with another $1.5 billion to be invested over time. Salesforce is also a backer.  
  Anthropic's new model suite, announced earlier this month, marks the first time the company has offered "multimodality," or adding options like photo and video capabilities to generative AI.  
  But multimodality, and increasingly complex AI models, also lead to more potential risks. Google recently took its AI image generator, part of its Gemini chatbot, offline after users discovered historical inaccuracies and questionable responses, which circulated widely on social media.  
  Anthropic's Claude 3 does not generate images. Instead, it only allows users to upload images and other documents for analysis.  
  "Of course no model is perfect, and I think that's a very important thing to say upfront," Anthropic co-founder Daniela Amodei told CNBC earlier this month. "We've tried very diligently to make these models the intersection of as capable and as safe as possible. Of course there are going to be places where the model still makes something up from time to time."  
  Amazon's biggest venture bet before Anthropic was electric vehicle maker Rivian, where it invested more than $1.3 billion. That too, was a strategic partnership.  
  These partnerships have been picking up in the face of more antitrust scrutiny. A drop in acquisitions by the Magnificent Seven — Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla — has been offset by an increase in venture-style investing, according to Pitchbook.  
  Big Tech's investments  
  AI and machine-learning investments from those seven tech companies jumped to $24.6 billion last year, up from $4.4 billion in 2022, according to Pitchbook. At the same time, Big Tech's M&A deals fell from 40 deals in 2022 to 13 last year.  
  "There is a sort of paranoia motivation to invest in potential disruptors," Pitchbook AI analyst Brendan Burke said in an interview. "The other motivation is to increase sales, and to invest in companies that are likely to use the other company's product — they tend to be partners, more so than competitors."  
  Big Tech's spending spree in AI has come under fire for the seemingly circular nature of these agreements. By investing in AI startups, some observers, including Benchmark's Bill Gurley, have accused the tech giants of funneling cash back to their cloud businesses, which in turn, may show up as revenue. Gurley described it as a way to "goose your own revenues."  
  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is taking a closer look at these partnerships, including Microsoft's OpenAI deal and Google and Amazon's Anthropic investments. What's sometimes called "round tripping" can be illegal — especially if the aim is to mislead investors. But Amazon has said that this type of venture investing does not constitute round tripping.  
  FTC Chair Lina Khan announced the inquiry during the agency's tech summit on AI, describing it as a "market inquiry into the investments and partnerships being formed between AI developers and major cloud service providers."  
  Correction: This article has been updated to clarify the deals Anthropic has closed in the past year.  
  FC Barcelona  
  Even before they changed the football landscape by inventing the tiki-taka style of play, FC Barcelona have been known for their likable and highly watchable brand of football that always seemed to produce results. During their long and immensely successful history, they have won tons of La Liga titles as well as Copa del Rey trophies, to which can be added Champions Leagues and Cup Winners' Cups. As one of the richest and most popular clubs in the world, they can afford to be owned and financed exclusively by their own supporters. Since its inception, Barcelona has been a major symbol of Catalonia and its culture, as evidenced by its motto, which says “More than a club” (Més que un club).

  History  
  In 1899, football pioneer Joan Gamper decided he wanted to form a football club. After eleven other enthusiasts responded to his newspaper advert, the dream became a reality and Barcelona was born. The new club started off its journey successfully enough; after losing to Bizcaya in the final of the inaugural Copa del Rey in 1902, Barcelona bounced back in style by winning the competition eight times between then and 1928 (they were also doing well in the regional Campionat de Catalunya).  
  The first golden era and the sudden end of it  
  The club's first golden era take place during the 1920s. The club dominated Campionat de Catalunya and the Copa del Rey with Paulino Alcántara as the first big goalscorer. In 1929 Barca clinched the inaugural La Liga before entering a period of decline due to the ongoing political conflicts in the country, which eventually grew so large that they resulted in the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and the beginning of Franco's regime. Gamper’s time in Barcelona ended abruptly after he was deported from Spain because of political reasons. A few years later he committed suicide. Josep Sunyol had become the new director of FC Barcelona. He was a left-wing politician and this would finally lead to his death, he was executed by the Francoist regime in 1938.  
  FC Barcelona in 1953.  
  While life under Franco was proving arduous from a political point of view (the club was in fact forced to change its name to the less Catalanian and Anglian sounding Barcelona Club de Futbol and the Catalan colors were removed from the crest), the next two decades were reasonably successful for the club. In the period from 1942 to 1957, Barcelona claimed five La Liga titles and five Copa del Rey trophies. Following their move to the newly built Camp Nou, the club's officials decided to turn a new leaf and appoint Helenio Herrera as the new manager. Under Herrera's guidance – and with a Ballon d'Or winner Luis Suárez (not the Uruguayan footballer) as the team's leader on the field – Barcelona won two consecutive La Ligas and one Copa del Rey in the next three years.  
  The worst decade  
  Even though Barcelona made the history books by becoming the first team to defeat Real Madrid in the European Cup, the 60s as a whole were largely a disappointing time for the club's supporters. With Di Stéfano in his prime, Real Madrid was simply too strong of an opponent and Barcelona, without the former star Kubala, had to settle with two Copa del Rey trophies for the decade. Ironically, this would prove to be a common theme in the coming years. In 1973 the Dutch star Johan Cruyff joined the club and was one of the reasons that the team managed to claim a La Liga title in 1974, the first in ten years. The waiting for the next league victory would again hang over ten years until the team with Terry Venables as manager could win another one. This era wasn't all doom and gloom for Barcelona, though, and the trophy collection would continue to increase rapidly since Barça were far more successful in the cup competitions. During this period, Barcelona won four Copa del Reys and two Cup Winners' Cups.

  In 1979, Cruyff came up with the idea of founding a football academy that would function on the same principles as the celebrated Ajax Youth Academy. His proposal was eventually accepted, and an old country building named La Masia was converted into the Academy headquarters. In the years that followed, La Masia became the most revered football academy in the entire world, known as much for its immaculate top-down organization as for the many players who passed through it and became stars. The list of La Masia-bred youngsters includes Josep "Pep" Guardiola, Cesc Fàbregas, Gerard Piqué and Lionel Messi. The year of 1988 is notable for Cruyff's return to Barcelona, this time in a position of manager. He immediately showcased his eye for talent by assembling a so-called "Dream Team," combining home-grown players such as Josep "Pep" Guardiola and Txiki Begiristain with international stars like Michael Laudrup, Romário and Hristo Stoichkov. Perhaps even more importantly, the football philosophy Cruyff brought with himself to the club served as a stepping stone to what would later become the tiki-taka system. Under Cruyff, Barcelona claimed four consecutive La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey trophies, one Cup Winners' Cup, as well as their first European Cup trophy. In addition to all his accomplishments while at Barcelona, Cruyff opened the club's door for other celebrated Dutch internationals. Barcelona's "Dutch connection" was at its most prominent during the 90s and early 00s, with Ronald Koeman, Patrick Kluivert and Giovanni van Bronckhorst in particular leaving a big mark at the club. The Dutch influence did not end with their players, either; shortly after Cruyff's departure from the club in 1996, Louis van Gaal took over as manager and continued a streak of good results by leading Barcelona to two La Ligas, two Copa del Reys and one Cup Winners' Cup, all before the turn of the century.  
  The imposing Camp Nou stadium.  
  A new era of domination  
  Losing Luís Figo – one of the club's heroes up until that point – to Real Madrid's "Los Galacticos" in 2000 proved to be a tough blow for Barça and their ambitions. The early 00s saw many changes in the club's personnel, but things didn't turn for the better until the arrival of another Dutchman in 2005 – Frank Rijkaard. Much like his compatriots Cruyff and Van Gaal before him, Rijkaard went on to form a star-studded team by combining expensive international signings such as Ronaldinho with a base of upcoming Spanish players like Carles Puyol, Xavi and Andrés Iniesta. With Rijkaard in charge, Barcelona won two La Ligas and one Champions League. In 2008, Pep Guardiola took over as the club's manager, having previously coached Barcelona's B Team. Being a product of La Masia himself, Guardiola fully understood the importance of the Academy and the possibilities it holds. His coaching methods focused primarily on the now-famous tiki-taka, a style of play combined Cruyff's penchant for quick passing and constant movement with maintaining possession at all costs. In addition to that, this tactic favored zonal marking over the traditional, formation-based system. Soon enough, tiki-taka turned into a conceptual revolution in its own right, leaving Barcelona in a great position to profit off it. During his four years at the helm, Guardiola turned Barcelona into the most dominant club in the world. Led by La Masia's newest wunderkind, Lionel Messi, Barcelona went on to decimate any opposition in their path, winning three La Ligas, two Copa del Reys and two Champions Leagues from 2008 to 2012. Even after Guardiola's departure, Barcelona would stick to the successful formula; in the years that followed, they claimed an additional two La Ligas, one Copa del Rey and the 2015 Champions League.  
  Sponsor controversy  
  Barcelona's blaugrana shirt was under a long time free from any sponsor logotypes (the exception was UNICEF, which wasn't a typical sponsor deal). But in 2010 a deal with the Qatar Foundation that would generate €30 million (for a contract between 2011 and 2015) was apparently too much to say no to. By many reasons this was controversially decisions. In addition to the fact that the T-shirt no longer was "clean" (the UNICEF logotype had been there for some years, but it was a completely different thing), it was a deal with a company from a country with a dictator regime. Even though the members (FC Barcelona is owned by its own members) said yes, many Barça fans have been doubtful to the deal.  
  By Martin Wahl  
  Logo  
  The current crest of FC Barcelona was designed in 1910, until then a diamond shaped crest had been used. The former logo had a crown above the shield analogues to the present logo of Real Madrid. The crest from 1910 was in fact design by a former player, Carles Comamala. Although Comamala's crest has been modified several times over the years, it is still very alike the first version. The upper left white and blue flag is actually England’s and the reason is that England and Catalonia have the same patron saint. The yellow and red flag in the upper right is the Catalonian. The initials have shifted from FCB. to CFB. and back to FCB. again, standing for Club de Futbol Barcelona and Football Club Barcelona, respectively.

  Maatsen impressed during Chelsea’s pre-season campaign last summer and was expected to be handed a regular role under Mauricio Pochettino.  
  However, the 22-year-old started just three games for Chelsea before he was allowed to join Borussia Dortmund in the January transfer window.  
  Maatsen has been one of Dortmund’s standout performers since his move to the Bundesliga and the club are keen to make the move permanent in the summer.  
  However, Sky Germany report that Bayern are seeking a possible replacement for Alphonso Davies, who is wanted by Real Madrid, and Maatsen is on their shortlist.  
  The report claims that Bayern have made an initial enquiry about Maatsen’s situation and will monitor his performances for the remainder of the season.  
  Dortmund were unable to agree a purchase option as part of their loan agreement with Chelsea in January.  
  And that means Bayern could take advantage of the £35 million release clause in the new contract Maatsen signed with Chelsea at the start of the year.  
  Speaking about his decision to leave Chelsea, Maatsen said in an interview with NOS last week: ‘I wanted to make a good move to get more minutes, and that has worked out well.  
  ‘Sometimes I don’t really dwell on the moment, but you could say it’s going like an express train at the moment.’

  'I have given my all every day to get back' - Lavia on injury frustrationpublished at 18:07  
  18:07  
  Romeo Lavia has sent a message to Chelsea's fans following the news he will miss the rest of this season because of injury.  
  The 20-year-old has made just one 32-minute substitute appearance for the Blues since signing from Southampton for an initial £53m last summer.  
  "This has been a frustrating season for me, not being able to help my team-mates," Lavia said.  
  "I love this squad, this badge and being on the pitch more than anything.  
  "Trust that I have given my all every day to get back.  
  "Thank you for the love, support and critics because they all affect me positively and keep me going.  
  "Can't wait to give it back and share many special moments."  
  Chelsea v Burnley: Pick of the statspublished at 16:09  
  16:09  
  Here are the key facts and figures before Saturday's Premier League fixture between Chelsea and Burnley.  
  Chelsea have lost just one of their 17 Premier League games against Burnley - a 3-2 home defeat on the opening weekend of the 2017-18 campaign.  
  Four of the five times the Clarets have avoided defeat by Chelsea in the Premier League have been at Stamford Bridge.  
  The Blues have scored at least once in their 17 Premier League games against Burnley - their best such record in the competition.  
  Only Luton Town (17) and Manchester City (13) are on longer runs of scoring in successive Premier League games than Chelsea's 11.  
  A goal and assist against Newcastle United last time out took Cole Palmer's league goal involvements this season to 19 (11 goals, eight assists). He could become only the fifth Chelsea player to reach at least 20 involvements in his first season in the competition, after Jimmy-Floyd Hasselbaink (32 in 2000-01), Eden Hazard (20 in 2012-13), Diego Costa (23 in 2014-15) and Cesc Fabregas (21 in 2014-15).  
  Nicolas Jackson has nine goals and nine yellow cards in the Premier League this season. He could become the third player to reach 10 for both in his first campaign after Paolo di Canio for West Ham (1997-98) and Charlie Adam for Blackpool (2010-11).

  The three things Blues need between now and the end of the seasonpublished at 13:02 26 March  
  13:02 26 March  
  Will Faulks Fan writer  
  If Chelsea are still to achieve their goals this season and turn a disappointing campaign into anything resembling a success, they will need three things to happen:  
  Keep players fit  
  By far the most important ingredient in achieving these goals is keeping the squad fit. Until recently, the aim was just to recover injured players. Now they are almost all back, and those still missing (Reece James and Christopher Nkunku) will not have enough time to make a significant impact on the run-in upon their return.  
  Some first-team players lack a quality alternative in the squad and losing them now would be a huge setback.  
  Settled defence  
  A second important factor will be settling on a first-choice defence. Dropping Thiago Silva is a move that should yield positive results, but so far injuries have made it hard for Mauricio Pochettino to make a concrete decision on who should replace him.  
  Our backline has become a weak point at the worst possible time and consistent selection is the first step on the road towards fixing it.  
  All being well, this Saturday's starting XI should give some answers about who Pochettino plans to use for the rest of the season.  
  Bring fans and club back together  
  The final ingredient necessary to turn this campaign into a positive one is to heal the growing rift between fans and the club.  
  The sources of the problems are numerous and deep-rooted. But, on the other hand, this goal is also the most straightforward to achieve.  
  Start winning consistently and the dark cloud hanging over the club will dissipate quickly.

  'The team and the club needs its supporters' - Fan Advisory Boardpublished at 16:28 25 March  
  16:28 25 March  
  Chelsea's fan advisory board (FAB) "want to set the record straight" and have responded to the Blues' supporters trust letter which expressed "significant concerns" about the club's future.  
  However, in a statement issued on Monday, FABb responded: "Bluntly, we don’t recognise the suggestion that fans are not being involved in the future of the club. This goes directly against our experience.  
  "The idea that fans are not involved, and not at a decision-making level, could not be further from the truth.  
  "The club is aware that while the FAB is constructive and understands the realities, we are also challenging. We make our views known forcefully. We achieve real change. We work and will continue to work on the relationship."  
  Since American investor Boehly's takeover in May 2022, Chelsea have finished 12th and seen four managers in the dugout.  
  Last summer, Mauricio Pochettino was put in charge but has been unable to significantly improve results. There have been chants of "you don't know what you're doing" aimed at the Argentine from the Stamford Bridge crowd in recent weeks and loud boos directed at players.  
  FAB called for supporters to get behind the team, arguing that only "other clubs" benefit from fans turning on each other.  
  "Football is a matter of opinion and expressing emotion is part of that," added FAB. "But we have to get behind our team and make our contribution to victory rather than seek chaos and division through attacks and campaigns.  
  "Every Chelsea fan (including the ownership group) is frustrated at setbacks or results that don’t go our way. But the team, and the club more broadly, needs its supporters.  
  "The only people who benefit from Chelsea fans turning on Chelsea are fans of other clubs."  
  'In-game management' - your biggest gripes of the seasonpublished at 12:59 25 March  
  12:59 25 March  
  We asked you what the most irritating thing at your club has been this season, whether it be inconsistency, injuries or a player failing to deliver.  
  Here are some of your replies:  
  Dougie: The most frustrating thing this season is injuries. I'm pretty sure we've never had fewer than eight, and it has often been more. Considering this, I think Pochettino has done very well, especially given the youth and lack of experience. We need to stick by him and let him develop this side - there is a lot of talent in there.  
  Rod: Owners who know nothing about English football. Owners who know nothing about the buying or selling of Premier League players. Owners who give absolutely ridiculous player contracts. Owners who cannot find a manager who lives up to his reputation. Owners who are ruining this club.  
  Liam: Pretty much everything. Owners spending a billion and then selling players fans loved. Injuries seem to happen every hour. Players out of position. Selfish players. Lack of game time for players who actually give us something different like Noni Madueke. Now potentially FFP. We're just lucky Palmer is mustard.  
  Dave: The fans - so much negativity and booing. Our players are 20-25 years old and putting their all in only to get booed. We all wanted the owners to buy world-class young players in the summer - they did exactly that and now we need to give the team time to gel and grow together. We are heading in the right direction (albeit slowly). Let's get behind them.  
  Connor: The inconsistencies within the team. One week we look a top-class outfit, then next we look lost at sea. Certain players have shined and instantly shown their value. Others are beginning to find their feet and start to look adjusted. However, there are a few players who I cannot understand why we keep playing. In-game management is also concerning.  
  PhilC: Pochettino being stubborn and sticking with players who don't perform. Robert Sanchez seems bereft of confidence so why muck about at the back? Raheem Sterling has one good game in 10 and doesn't look like he is interested. Playing Nicolas Jackson has shown how a young player can improve so give someone else a chance instead of Sterling.  
  Chukwuemeka returns early from international dutypublished at 12:17 25 March  
  12:17 25 March  
  Midfielder Carney Chukwuemeka has returned to Chelsea early from international duty.  
  The 20-year-old had been called up to the England Under-21 side for the first time for the Young Lions' Euro qualification games against Azerbaijan and Luxembourg.  
  Chukwuemeka didn't feature in the 5-1 win in Azerbaijan on Friday and has now returned to Chelsea's training ground early to "to work on his fitness at Cobham", said the club.  
  He has been in and out of the Blues' side with injury this season, featuring just nine times. Howevcer, he has scored twice - including in their last game before the international break against Leicester City - and made one assist.  
  Mauricio Pochettino will be hoping the early return will help Chukwuemeka to play a key role in the remainder of the campaign as the side look to secure European football and win a piece of silverware.  
  Cole inducted into Premier League Hall of Famepublished at 11:19 25 March  
  11:19 25 March  
  Former Arsenal and Chelsea defender Ashley Cole has been inducted into the Premier League Hall Of Fame.  
  Often regarded as one of the best left-backs in the competition's history, Cole becomes the 22nd inductee on to the list of ex-players and managers that began in 2021.  
  The 43-year-old won three titles - two with Arsenal and one with Chelsea. He was part of the Gunners' 'Invincibles' in 2003-04 and the Blues side that scored a then-record 103 goals in 2009-10.  
  Cole made 385 Premier League appearances, contributing to 147 clean sheets, scoring 15 goals and providing 31 assists.  
  "I'm honoured to join the Premier League Hall of Fame," said the former England international. "It's humbling and fulfilling to be rewarded at the end of your career.  
  "I went through my career just trying to give my best and be good enough. You take it day by day and game by game. As a young kid, you never dream of any of this and you just do it for the love of the game of football.  
  "I played for some fantastic clubs with incredible fans. Winning trophies with my boyhood club Arsenal and with Chelsea are amazing memories that will always be with me.  
  "It's emotional to reflect because a lot of hard work has been put in. To join the Hall of Fame alongside the likes of Alan Shearer, Thierry Henry, Didier Drogba and Rio Ferdinand, I'm privileged to be in their company."  
  'I'll continue to work my hardest for Chelsea'published at 10:40 25 March  
  10:40 25 March  
  Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher is hoping a strong end to the season with his club can help him get a place in the England squad for Euro 2024.  
  The 24-year-old has regularly put in strong performances for the Blues this season, despite the inconsistencies that mean they are 11th in the Premier League.  
  There could still be a positive end to the campaign for Mauricio Pochettino and his team with an FA Cup semi-final still to come and only five points the difference to a guaranteed European spot via the league.  
  Gallagher is battling for a place in Gareth Southgate's 23-man squad for the summer tournament in Germany and club form could be key.  
  "There are a lot of world-class players in the [England] squad - a lot of top midfielders - so it is always healthy competition," said Gallagher.  
  "I am always willing to do the best I can to give myself the best opportunity to play. The squad is a very close squad. We all want each other to do well and only want the best for each other.  
  "It always helps when you are performing well for your club. It is what Gareth and the others are looking at.  
  "I'll continue to work my hardest for Chelsea and give myself the best opportunity to be in that squad."  
  If Gallagher does make the squad for Germany, he said any question marks on his club future would be put to one side.  
  "When it comes to it I'll be focusing on England and the task in hand," he added.  
  "I've had to step up and be more of a leader this season at Chelsea, which I've really enjoyed and I think that's helped me develop.  
  "In the tournaments coming up with England, gaining the experience I've had in the two cup competitions with Chelsea and getting as far as we have done will definitely help."

  The left-hand-side 'dilemma' - England XI for Euros - published at 17:19 22 March  
  17:19 22 March  
  England do not have a natural player who would be our obvious number one on the left-hand-side and it is a slight concern given it is not as clear-cut as other areas of the pitch.  
  Do you play Phil Foden out on the left and bring and let Kobbie Mainoo, Conor Gallagher or Kalvin Phillips force their way in? This is my dilemma.  
  If we are talking on current form then Cole Palmer gets the nod from me. Ideally you would not want to play Palmer in that position, but he has done it before.  
  Foden could go central or off the left-hand-side.  
  Manchester United's Marcus Rashford is also an extremely experienced player who can play in that role. He just needs a good eight remaining weeks of the season.  
  There is one other curveball. Does Gareth Southgate see Trent Alexander-Arnold in that other midfield spot? If he does, then that would release Foden out on to the left.  
  We also know Jack Grealish can play off that left-hand-side but he needs to get back from injury because he could be a late push for that position as well. He has got to get back and play some minutes for Manchester City, but he could fit there.  
  We’re going to see Gareth Southgate’s hand in these next two friendlies. Let’s see how he starts against Brazil. Will he use it to work on that midfield three and use Declan Rice, Jude Bellingham and Foden?

  'Booing your own only gets you so far'published at 10:47 20 March  
  10:47 20 March  
  Ross Mooring Fan writer  
  It is difficult not to imagine a world in which a very expensively assembled squad representing a club used to winning trophies for the best part of three decades, but which finds itself in the most mid-table of positions and recently rather meekly lost a domestic cup final, would not occasionally be admonished by its own supporters.  
  Mauricio Pochettino taking a large brunt of that over recent weeks is not a surprise. This Chelsea team is nowhere near the finished article and often lacks composure and resilience in attack and defence.  
  On the playing-side, Raheem Sterling has been a lightning rod for criticism for longer than just Sunday's 4-2 FA Cup win over Leicester.  
  On the surface, it seems odd that the player who topped the goals and assists charts for the Blues last season and is in the top three for both this campaign would attract such ire, but it is almost precisely because Sterling creates chances for himself and others on a regular basis that it is frustrating to see him spurn similar moments.  
  Sterling's performance against Leicester was almost a microcosm of this. While he let himself down with a very poorly taken penalty and a bizarrely errant free-kick, he also neatly laid on Cole Palmer's goal and won said penalty himself. However, once he took the ball from Palmer for both dead ball situations, Sterling simply had to do far better with his execution, something he no doubt knows himself.  
  One player who is very much en-vogue with Chelsea supporters this season and without whom Reece James' presence would be even more sorely missed is Malo Gusto.  
  The speedy full back has contributed admirably at both ends of the pitch in his debut season. It would be worth fans taking note of his admonishment of the Matthew Harding Lower's booing of his team-mate's late free kick as it flew into orbit over Stamford Bridge however. After all, booing your own only gets you so far.  
  How fair is Sterling criticism?published at 09:35 20 March  
  09:35 20 March  
  Nicola Pearson BBC Sport journalist  
  A poor penalty attempt, a free-kick that would be more at home on a rugby field, a one-on-one chance against the keeper put well wide and booed by his own fans.  
  It's safe to say Raheem Sterling has had better days at the office than what he endured on Sunday against Leicester City in the FA Cup.  
  But on a day where defender Axel Disasi also scored a frankly bizarre own-goal that set in motion Chelsea's near second-half capitulation, and one where Robert Sanchez was caught out trying to play out from the back on multiple occasions and looked less than a commanding presence in the box throughout, is the criticism that has come Sterling's way unfair?  
  While he missed some glaring opportunities, he did also assist Cole Palmer's goal, had the most big chances, made the most dribbles, created the join-most chances and had the second most shots and touches in the opposition box in the match - simply put, he was one of the most positive players in attack.  
  Finishing has never been the strongest suit in the 29-year-old's deck of skills - despite scoring 171 club career goals - and it has been emphasised in a Blues side that has struggled on that front all season.  
  Palmer's outstanding campaign since arriving from Sterling's former club Manchester City in the summer may have also risen expectations of what is looked for from his more experienced counterpart.  
  But, when you look closer at Sterling's figures in the Premier League so far this term in comparison to his team-mates, he has still been one of the higher performers.  
  According to Opta, alongside Malo Gusto he has made the most crosses, he sits third for goals and shots taken, joint-third for chances created and joint-fourth for assists.  
  Typically it is the final touch in front of goal that has let him down, having a conversion rate of just 13.6% (ninth amongst Chelsea players) and despite having the second most big chances at 14, he is also second for most big chances missed with 10.  
  The England international apologised on his social media, external after the game for the missed penalty and said he would "continue to keep fighting for the badge every single day", but that is unlikely to appease frustrated supporters.  
  Sterling was supposed to be Todd Boehly's 'statement' signing when he first took over the club, but perhaps the forward's past with previous teams meant there was always going to be a disconnect with the fans that had him on the backfoot from the start.  
  'The melodrama surrounding Sterling will live long in the memory'published at 09:35 20 March  
  09:35 20 March  
  Pat Nevin Former footballer and presenter  
  Chelsea needed to win to save their entire season and Leicester had far bigger fish to fry with promotion to the Premier League being their main focus, so I thought it might be dull.

  'I have given my all every day to get back' - Lavia on injury frustrationpublished at 18:07  
  18:07  
  Romeo Lavia has sent a message to Chelsea's fans following the news he will miss the rest of this season because of injury.  
  The 20-year-old has made just one 32-minute substitute appearance for the Blues since signing from Southampton for an initial £53m last summer.  
  "This has been a frustrating season for me, not being able to help my team-mates," Lavia said.  
  "I love this squad, this badge and being on the pitch more than anything.  
  "Trust that I have given my all every day to get back.  
  "Thank you for the love, support and critics because they all affect me positively and keep me going.

  Chelsea v Burnley: Pick of the statspublished at 16:09  
  16:09  
  Here are the key facts and figures before Saturday's Premier League fixture between Chelsea and Burnley.  
  Chelsea have lost just one of their 17 Premier League games against Burnley - a 3-2 home defeat on the opening weekend of the 2017-18 campaign.  
  Four of the five times the Clarets have avoided defeat by Chelsea in the Premier League have been at Stamford Bridge.  
  The Blues have scored at least once in their 17 Premier League games against Burnley - their best such record in the competition.  
  Only Luton Town (17) and Manchester City (13) are on longer runs of scoring in successive Premier League games than Chelsea's 11.  
  A goal and assist against Newcastle United last time out took Cole Palmer's league goal involvements this season to 19 (11 goals, eight assists). He could become only the fifth Chelsea player to reach at least 20 involvements in his first season in the competition, after Jimmy-Floyd Hasselbaink (32 in 2000-01), Eden Hazard (20 in 2012-13), Diego Costa (23 in 2014-15) and Cesc Fabregas (21 in 2014-15).  
  Nicolas Jackson has nine goals and nine yellow cards in the Premier League this season. He could become the third player to reach 10 for both in his first campaign after Paolo di Canio for West Ham (1997-98) and Charlie Adam for Blackpool (2010-11).

  The three things Blues need between now and the end of the seasonpublished at 13:02 26 March  
  13:02 26 March  
  Will Faulks Fan writer  
  If Chelsea are still to achieve their goals this season and turn a disappointing campaign into anything resembling a success, they will need three things to happen:  
  Keep players fit  
  By far the most important ingredient in achieving these goals is keeping the squad fit. Until recently, the aim was just to recover injured players. Now they are almost all back, and those still missing (Reece James and Christopher Nkunku) will not have enough time to make a significant impact on the run-in upon their return.  
  Some first-team players lack a quality alternative in the squad and losing them now would be a huge setback.  
  Settled defence  
  A second important factor will be settling on a first-choice defence. Dropping Thiago Silva is a move that should yield positive results, but so far injuries have made it hard for Mauricio Pochettino to make a concrete decision on who should replace him.  
  Our backline has become a weak point at the worst possible time and consistent selection is the first step on the road towards fixing it.  
  All being well, this Saturday's starting XI should give some answers about who Pochettino plans to use for the rest of the season.  
  Bring fans and club back together  
  The final ingredient necessary to turn this campaign into a positive one is to heal the growing rift between fans and the club.  
  The sources of the problems are numerous and deep-rooted. But, on the other hand, this goal is also the most straightforward to achieve.  
  Start winning consistently and the dark cloud hanging over the club will dissipate quickly.

  'The team and the club needs its supporters' - Fan Advisory Boardpublished at 16:28 25 March  
  16:28 25 March  
  Chelsea's fan advisory board (FAB) "want to set the record straight" and have responded to the Blues' supporters trust letter which expressed "significant concerns" about the club's future.  
  However, in a statement issued on Monday, FABb responded: "Bluntly, we don’t recognise the suggestion that fans are not being involved in the future of the club. This goes directly against our experience.  
  "The idea that fans are not involved, and not at a decision-making level, could not be further from the truth.  
  "The club is aware that while the FAB is constructive and understands the realities, we are also challenging. We make our views known forcefully. We achieve real change. We work and will continue to work on the relationship."  
  Since American investor Boehly's takeover in May 2022, Chelsea have finished 12th and seen four managers in the dugout.  
  Last summer, Mauricio Pochettino was put in charge but has been unable to significantly improve results. There have been chants of "you don't know what you're doing" aimed at the Argentine from the Stamford Bridge crowd in recent weeks and loud boos directed at players.  
  FAB called for supporters to get behind the team, arguing that only "other clubs" benefit from fans turning on each other.  
  "Football is a matter of opinion and expressing emotion is part of that," added FAB. "But we have to get behind our team and make our contribution to victory rather than seek chaos and division through attacks and campaigns.  
  "Every Chelsea fan (including the ownership group) is frustrated at setbacks or results that don’t go our way. But the team, and the club more broadly, needs its supporters.  
  "The only people who benefit from Chelsea fans turning on Chelsea are fans of other clubs."  
  'In-game management' - your biggest gripes of the seasonpublished at 12:59 25 March  
  12:59 25 March  
  We asked you what the most irritating thing at your club has been this season, whether it be inconsistency, injuries or a player failing to deliver.  
  Here are some of your replies:  
  Dougie: The most frustrating thing this season is injuries. I'm pretty sure we've never had fewer than eight, and it has often been more. Considering this, I think Pochettino has done very well, especially given the youth and lack of experience. We need to stick by him and let him develop this side - there is a lot of talent in there.  
  Rod: Owners who know nothing about English football. Owners who know nothing about the buying or selling of Premier League players. Owners who give absolutely ridiculous player contracts. Owners who cannot find a manager who lives up to his reputation. Owners who are ruining this club.  
  Liam: Pretty much everything. Owners spending a billion and then selling players fans loved. Injuries seem to happen every hour. Players out of position. Selfish players. Lack of game time for players who actually give us something different like Noni Madueke. Now potentially FFP. We're just lucky Palmer is mustard.  
  Dave: The fans - so much negativity and booing. Our players are 20-25 years old and putting their all in only to get booed. We all wanted the owners to buy world-class young players in the summer - they did exactly that and now we need to give the team time to gel and grow together. We are heading in the right direction (albeit slowly). Let's get behind them.  
  Connor: The inconsistencies within the team. One week we look a top-class outfit, then next we look lost at sea. Certain players have shined and instantly shown their value. Others are beginning to find their feet and start to look adjusted. However, there are a few players who I cannot understand why we keep playing. In-game management is also concerning.  
  PhilC: Pochettino being stubborn and sticking with players who don't perform. Robert Sanchez seems bereft of confidence so why muck about at the back? Raheem Sterling has one good game in 10 and doesn't look like he is interested. Playing Nicolas Jackson has shown how a young player can improve so give someone else a chance instead of Sterling.

  Midfielder Carney Chukwuemeka has returned to Chelsea early from international duty.  
  The 20-year-old had been called up to the England Under-21 side for the first time for the Young Lions' Euro qualification games against Azerbaijan and Luxembourg.  
  Chukwuemeka didn't feature in the 5-1 win in Azerbaijan on Friday and has now returned to Chelsea's training ground early to "to work on his fitness at Cobham", said the club.  
  He has been in and out of the Blues' side with injury this season, featuring just nine times. Howevcer, he has scored twice - including in their last game before the international break against Leicester City - and made one assist.  
  Mauricio Pochettino will be hoping the early return will help Chukwuemeka to play a key role in the remainder of the campaign as the side look to secure European football and win a piece of silverware.

  Often regarded as one of the best left-backs in the competition's history, Cole becomes the 22nd inductee on to the list of ex-players and managers that began in 2021.  
  The 43-year-old won three titles - two with Arsenal and one with Chelsea. He was part of the Gunners' 'Invincibles' in 2003-04 and the Blues side that scored a then-record 103 goals in 2009-10.  
  Cole made 385 Premier League appearances, contributing to 147 clean sheets, scoring 15 goals and providing 31 assists.  
  "I'm honoured to join the Premier League Hall of Fame," said the former England international. "It's humbling and fulfilling to be rewarded at the end of your career.  
  "I went through my career just trying to give my best and be good enough. You take it day by day and game by game. As a young kid, you never dream of any of this and you just do it for the love of the game of football.  
  "I played for some fantastic clubs with incredible fans. Winning trophies with my boyhood club Arsenal and with Chelsea are amazing memories that will always be with me.  
  "It's emotional to reflect because a lot of hard work has been put in. To join the Hall of Fame alongside the likes of Alan Shearer, Thierry Henry, Didier Drogba and Rio Ferdinand, I'm privileged to be in their company."  
  'I'll continue to work my hardest for Chelsea'published at 10:40 25 March  
  10:40 25 March  
  Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher is hoping a strong end to the season with his club can help him get a place in the England squad for Euro 2024.  
  The 24-year-old has regularly put in strong performances for the Blues this season, despite the inconsistencies that mean they are 11th in the Premier League.  
  There could still be a positive end to the campaign for Mauricio Pochettino and his team with an FA Cup semi-final still to come and only five points the difference to a guaranteed European spot via the league.  
  Gallagher is battling for a place in Gareth Southgate's 23-man squad for the summer tournament in Germany and club form could be key.  
  "There are a lot of world-class players in the [England] squad - a lot of top midfielders - so it is always healthy competition," said Gallagher.  
  "I am always willing to do the best I can to give myself the best opportunity to play. The squad is a very close squad. We all want each other to do well and only want the best for each other.  
  "It always helps when you are performing well for your club. It is what Gareth and the others are looking at.  
  "I'll continue to work my hardest for Chelsea and give myself the best opportunity to be in that squad."  
  If Gallagher does make the squad for Germany, he said any question marks on his club future would be put to one side.  
  "When it comes to it I'll be focusing on England and the task in hand," he added.  
  "I've had to step up and be more of a leader this season at Chelsea, which I've really enjoyed and I think that's helped me develop.  
  "In the tournaments coming up with England, gaining the experience I've had in the two cup competitions with Chelsea and getting as far as we have done will definitely help."

  The left-hand-side 'dilemma' - England XI for Euros - published at 17:19 22 March  
  17:19 22 March  
  England do not have a natural player who would be our obvious number one on the left-hand-side and it is a slight concern given it is not as clear-cut as other areas of the pitch.  
  Do you play Phil Foden out on the left and bring and let Kobbie Mainoo, Conor Gallagher or Kalvin Phillips force their way in? This is my dilemma.  
  If we are talking on current form then Cole Palmer gets the nod from me. Ideally you would not want to play Palmer in that position, but he has done it before.  
  Foden could go central or off the left-hand-side.  
  Manchester United's Marcus Rashford is also an extremely experienced player who can play in that role. He just needs a good eight remaining weeks of the season.  
  There is one other curveball. Does Gareth Southgate see Trent Alexander-Arnold in that other midfield spot? If he does, then that would release Foden out on to the left.  
  We also know Jack Grealish can play off that left-hand-side but he needs to get back from injury because he could be a late push for that position as well. He has got to get back and play some minutes for Manchester City, but he could fit there.  
  We’re going to see Gareth Southgate’s hand in these next two friendlies. Let’s see how he starts against Brazil. Will he use it to work on that midfield three and use Declan Rice, Jude Bellingham and Foden?

  'Booing your own only gets you so far'published at 10:47 20 March  
  10:47 20 March  
  Ross Mooring Fan writer  
  It is difficult not to imagine a world in which a very expensively assembled squad representing a club used to winning trophies for the best part of three decades, but which finds itself in the most mid-table of positions and recently rather meekly lost a domestic cup final, would not occasionally be admonished by its own supporters.  
  Mauricio Pochettino taking a large brunt of that over recent weeks is not a surprise. This Chelsea team is nowhere near the finished article and often lacks composure and resilience in attack and defence.  
  On the playing-side, Raheem Sterling has been a lightning rod for criticism for longer than just Sunday's 4-2 FA Cup win over Leicester.  
  On the surface, it seems odd that the player who topped the goals and assists charts for the Blues last season and is in the top three for both this campaign would attract such ire, but it is almost precisely because Sterling creates chances for himself and others on a regular basis that it is frustrating to see him spurn similar moments.  
  Sterling's performance against Leicester was almost a microcosm of this. While he let himself down with a very poorly taken penalty and a bizarrely errant free-kick, he also neatly laid on Cole Palmer's goal and won said penalty himself. However, once he took the ball from Palmer for both dead ball situations, Sterling simply had to do far better with his execution, something he no doubt knows himself.  
  One player who is very much en-vogue with Chelsea supporters this season and without whom Reece James' presence would be even more sorely missed is Malo Gusto.  
  The speedy full back has contributed admirably at both ends of the pitch in his debut season. It would be worth fans taking note of his admonishment of the Matthew Harding Lower's booing of his team-mate's late free kick as it flew into orbit over Stamford Bridge however. After all, booing your own only gets you so far.  
  How fair is Sterling criticism?published at 09:35 20 March  
  09:35 20 March  
  Nicola Pearson BBC Sport journalist  
  A poor penalty attempt, a free-kick that would be more at home on a rugby field, a one-on-one chance against the keeper put well wide and booed by his own fans.  
  It's safe to say Raheem Sterling has had better days at the office than what he endured on Sunday against Leicester City in the FA Cup.  
  But on a day where defender Axel Disasi also scored a frankly bizarre own-goal that set in motion Chelsea's near second-half capitulation, and one where Robert Sanchez was caught out trying to play out from the back on multiple occasions and looked less than a commanding presence in the box throughout, is the criticism that has come Sterling's way unfair?  
  While he missed some glaring opportunities, he did also assist Cole Palmer's goal, had the most big chances, made the most dribbles, created the join-most chances and had the second most shots and touches in the opposition box in the match - simply put, he was one of the most positive players in attack.  
  Finishing has never been the strongest suit in the 29-year-old's deck of skills - despite scoring 171 club career goals - and it has been emphasised in a Blues side that has struggled on that front all season.  
  Palmer's outstanding campaign since arriving from Sterling's former club Manchester City in the summer may have also risen expectations of what is looked for from his more experienced counterpart.  
  But, when you look closer at Sterling's figures in the Premier League so far this term in comparison to his team-mates, he has still been one of the higher performers.  
  According to Opta, alongside Malo Gusto he has made the most crosses, he sits third for goals and shots taken, joint-third for chances created and joint-fourth for assists.  
  Typically it is the final touch in front of goal that has let him down, having a conversion rate of just 13.6% (ninth amongst Chelsea players) and despite having the second most big chances at 14, he is also second for most big chances missed with 10.  
  The England international apologised on his social media, external after the game for the missed penalty and said he would "continue to keep fighting for the badge every single day", but that is unlikely to appease frustrated supporters.  
  Sterling was supposed to be Todd Boehly's 'statement' signing when he first took over the club, but perhaps the forward's past with previous teams meant there was always going to be a disconnect with the fans that had him on the backfoot from the start.

  FREE TO WATCH: Highlights from the Premier League clash between Chelsea and Brentford.  
  Brentford became the first side in the Premier League era to win their first three matches at Stamford Bridge as Ethan Pinnock and Bryan Mbeumo earned them a 2-0 victory over Chelsea.  
  Mauricio Pochettino looked to be turning the Blues' form around after three wins and a draw in their past four matches but he was left to rue another wasteful performance from his forwards, admitting after the game his side does not possess enough goalscorers.  
  This contest was remarkably similar to the Bees' two previous trips to play their west London rivals, with Chelsea dominating possession, missing several presentable chances and then allowing the visitors to punish their sloppiness, with an unmarked Ethan Pinnock heading the opener just before the hour.  
  Chelsea lacked both the creativity and quality to break down Brentford, who were happy to soak up the pressure before sealing the win through Bryan Mbeumo's breakaway goal deep into stoppage time.

  How Bees stung Blues yet again  
  Pochettino’s face at full-time said more than any words could. His face a blend of anger, frustration and disbelief, the manager was no doubt wondering how his side had fallen into the same trap against a Brentford side that have their number.  
  Chelsea came flying out of the blocks, hitting the bar through a curling Noni Madueke effort before Marc Cucurella and Raheem Sterling squandered big chances.  
  Team news  
  Chelsea: Axel Disasi returned in place of Malo Gusto, while Mykhailo Mudryk and Enzo Fernandez were replaced by Noni Madueke and Nicolas Jackson after picking up injuries  
  Brentford: Mads Roerslev and Aaron Hickey returned as the Bees moved to a 3-5-2 formation, with Frank Onyeka and Neal Maupay missing out  
  But it didn’t feel too concerning at that point for Chelsea, with it seeming like a case of when, and not if, they would take the lead.  
  Also See:  
  But Brentford know what it takes to win at Stamford Bridge and began to stem the flow of chances before going in front against the run of play, with Axel Disasi somehow losing Pinnock at the far post.  
  After earning 4-1 and 2-0 victories here in recent seasons, Thomas Frank’s side backed themselves to sit deep and once again frustrate their hosts, who become increasingly vulnerable to the counter-attack.  
  Chelsea barely created a chance in the final half hour, while Robert Sanchez was forced to deny Mbeumo and Yegor Yarmolyuk in the closing minutes.  
  But Brentford would not be denied their clincher and it came in farcical scenes, with Sanchez vainly giving chase to Neal Maupay after coming up for a corner before stumbling to the ground as Mbeumo tapped the ball into the empty net.  
  Most Chelsea supporters were long gone by the time the final whistle finally sounded, but those that remained unleashed a chorus of boos, with Pochettino silently taking it all in.  
  Pochettino: We have to blame ourselves  
  Pochettino said Chelsea had to take the blame for their eighth home defeat in the Premier League in 2023, saying: "The analysis is clear. In the first half, we should score and we didn't score.  
  "We dominated, created chances and the opponent didn't cross the halfway line. We need to blame ourselves because we were not nasty or clinical.  
  "In the second half, we cannot concede these types of goals and this is our mistake."  
  Chelsea drew a blank for the third time in their last four league games at Stamford Bridge and when asked whether there are enough goalscorers in his squad, Pochettino admitted: "At the moment, no.  
  "[Christopher] Nkunku proved he can score in the big leagues but was injured in the last pre-season game.  
  "We need to recover [Armando] Broja. Jackson is young and needs time to adapt.  
  "In your analysis, I think on some points we agree."

  Pochettino has cut a calm figure since joining Chelsea, refusing to get too low after troubling defeats and keeping his feet on the ground amid talk of a corner being turned in recent weeks.  
  But he was unusually tetchy from an early stage against Brentford, even shouting down an overly vocal home fan when they saw fit to offer Jackson some unprompted advice from behind the dugout.  
  This was a big game for Chelsea, a chance not just to end their neighbours’ dominance of this fixture but also continue the momentum generated by the seven points picked up from the last three games.  
  Instead, Pochettino’s side must face up to reality. No ever-present Premier League team has won fewer home games than their two since the start of February, while they have now failed to win 11 of their last 13 London derbies.  
  Having once ruled the roost in the capital, Chelsea are not even the best team in west London anymore.  
  Frank praises second-half improvement  
  Frank was delighted with the way Brentford improved in the second half, saying: "I think actually our first half was a little less than average.  
  "At half-time, I said to my players they needed to believe. On the ball, I don’t think we were cool enough.  
  "Our defending was so much better [in the second half] and the goal changed the dynamic."  
  Despite seeing Brentford move above them in the Premier League, Frank praised Pochettino's work at Chelsea, saying: "It’s clear what they want to achieve.  
  "They won three in a row and then drew against Arsenal - that’s a clear improvement.  
  "First half, you could see they came with a lot of confidence and they troubled us. I would take a lot of positives out of the first half."  
  Opta stats: Chelsea's miserable home form continues  
  Chelsea have lost their eighth Premier League home game in 2023 (W3 D7), their most home league defeats in a calendar year since 1986 (10).  
  Brentford have won four consecutive away London derbies for the first time in their league history, while they’re unbeaten in each of their last 13 against fellow London rivals in the Premier League (W7 D6).  
  Chelsea have lost five of their last seven London derbies in the Premier League (W1 D1), as many defeats as in their previous 19 such games beforehand (W10 D4).  
  Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo has been directly involved in five Premier League goals (two goals, three assists) against Chelsea, more goal involvements than he has against any other side in the competition.  
  Chelsea host Championship side Blackburn in the Carabao Cup fourth round on Wednesday - kick-off 7.45pm.  
  The Blues then return to Premier League action with a Monday Night Football trip to Tottenham on November 6 - kick-off 8pm.  
  Live MNF  
  Brentford's next game is at home to West Ham on Saturday - kick-off 3pm.

  Chelsea might be in the FA Cup semi-final and have 11 matches left to play in the Premier League this season, but some people's attention has already turned to the 2024 summer transfer window.  
  The future of Mauricio Pochettino remains uncertain with the club set to assess the Argentine's situation in the summer. That has always been the plan and a lot will likely rely on what happens between now and the conclusion of the campaign.  
  But whether or not Pochettino is still with the club to oversee what is expected to be a busy summer transfer window remains to be seen. Either way, Chelsea are expected to address a few key areas over the summer, while some players are set to be shipped off to help the club fall in line with the Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR).  
  Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart, the club's two technical directors, are set for a busy summer again as Chelsea look to strengthen their options after a season that has shown a few big weaknesses in the squad. With that said, Bobby Vincent takes a look at some areas that are bound to be addressed before the start of the 2024/25 season.  
  Where will Chelsea look to add this summer?  
  Goalkeeper may have been one area the club had plans for this summer but the form of Djordje Petrovic will have changed their minds on that. The Serbian shot-stopper has been excellent for the Blues since breaking into the first-team at the end of 2023 and in Robert Sanchez, Pochettino has a more than adequate back-up option.  
  Chelsea are looking at left-back options, football.london understands. Despite Marc Cucurella impressing since his return from injury, the club view him as an expendable option. The Spaniard will not be short of interest in the summer but the Blues may find it difficult to recoup the £60million fee they paid Brighton in the summer of 2022.  
  Ian Maatsen signed a new contract upon his agreement to join Borussia Dortmund until the summer. But the future of the Netherlands international remains up in the air with the Blues still viewing him as someone that could be sold to help with PSR in the summer.  
  Antonee Robinson from Fulham, who has been really impressive for the Cottagers this season, has been looked at. However, there is nothing more than an admiration for the American left-back as it stands, although that could change in the summer window.  
  A wide attacker and a striker are being looked at. Raheem Sterling is happy at Chelsea despite recent criticism, including the winger facing mass boos during his poor performance against Leicester City at the weekend.  
  There is – and has been since last summer – interest from Saudi Arabia in Sterling. The 29-year-old, though, remains committed to Chelsea with his contract at Stamford Bridge still having more than three years left to run.  
  Victor Osimhen is the club's top striker target still despite Paris Saint-Germain now being firmly in the race to sign the Nigerian striker. Viktor Gyokeres has been strongly linked with a move to Chelsea with the Sweden international scoring 36 goals in all competitions this season for Sporting CP.  
  There were rumours the Blues made an offer to the Portuguese club in January for Gyokeres. football.london, however, understands such reports were wide off the mark.  
  The big one in terms of possible departures is Conor Gallagher. Chelsea have not offered the England international an extension on his deal just yet, with his contract set to expire in just over 12 months' time. football.london understands there has been pre-contract talks, although they, as of yet, have not transpired into anything concrete.  
  Pochettino has been asked about Gallagher, who would like to stay at Chelsea in an ideal world, plenty of times in recent months. The Argentine, though, believes he is powerless in the situation and it is instead down to the player and the club.  
  "It is between the club and Conor," Pochettino said at the start of the month. "I am the coach that needs to be in my place. I cannot say nothing."

  Chelsea Fan Advisory Board hits back at ‘attacks and campaigns’ from angry supporters  
  FAB issued marked response following letter directed at the owners claiming the club had ‘become a laughing stock’  
  Matt Law, Football News Correspondent 25 March 2024 • 5:00pm  
  Chelsea’s Fan Advisory Board has hit back at the “attacks and campaigns” against owners Todd Boehly, Behdad Eghbali and Jose Feliciano, and urged supporters to pull in the same direction.  
  Boehly, Eghbali and Feliciano were warned of the threat of “irreversible toxicity” towards them after Chelsea’s Supporters’ Trust were left dissatisfied by a number of concerns raised with chief executive Chris Jurasek.  
  Chelsea have not commented on the Trust’s statement and Jurasek declined an interview to address the concerns raised with Telegraph Sport, saying he is “fully focused on the task at hand and that’s to build Chelsea FC into a club our supporters can be proud of”.  
  In a 1,500-word letter from the Trust, Chelsea’s owners were also told the club is a laughing stock and Telegraph Sport revealed that Boehly, Eghbali and Feliciano had become the target of a Stamford Bridge sticker campaign, depicting them as clowns.  
  In response to the criticism, the club’s official Fan Advisory Board, of which Supporters’ Trust chairman Mark Meehan is a member, have released a statement.  
  In it, the FAB said they “don’t recognise the suggestion that fans are not being involved in the future of the club” and insisted they have been in dialogue with Boehly and Eghbali over ticketing. But they added that the details of their meetings must remain confidential.  
  The statement finished by saying: “The only people who benefit from Chelsea fans turning on Chelsea are fans of other clubs. If we’re pulling in the same direction then ‘every little thing gonna be alright’.”  
  The FAB have requested that their statement was published in full and it said: “Following some stories in the press about supporter engagement and the atmosphere at Chelsea Football Club, the Fan Advisory Board thought it would be useful to let fans know about some of the work we have been doing to ensure the supporter voice is heard.  
  “Bluntly, we don’t recognise the suggestion that fans are not being involved in the future of the club. This goes directly against our experience. So we wanted to set the record straight.  
  “Chelsea’s FAB is a pioneering effort, created around a year ago, to ensure that the fan’s voice is listened to across the club. Our Chair Neil Beard was elected by members and ST holders in an open vote. The FAB represents a wide and diverse range of the Chelsea FC supporter base and constitutes an advisor selected through the Fans’ Forum [Gary Beckwith], the other board advisor through diversity equality and Chelsea Pride [Tracy Brown, FAB Vice Chair]. In addition, four additional FAB members were selected via an open application process, one of whom is the Chairman of the Chelsea Supporters’ Trust and another represents the views of overseas supporters. In this way the FAB ensures it is very broadly in touch with supporter sentiment, to collect and present these views very directly to the club and its board members.  
  “Supporters are able to contact the FAB board members directly via the club website and the FAB hold regular in-person drop-in sessions at the Tea Bar at Stamford Bridge, behind the Shed End. The next one is from 12:30pm ahead of the Burnley game on Saturday.  
  “At Chelsea Football Club’s last main board meeting (on March 11th), Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali directly (and in-person) asked the FAB to help shape the club’s proposals in relation to ticketing and we have been working on exactly that. We have had multiple sessions with club executives to work through potential proposals and provided with data to help substantiate any potential changes.  
  “So whilst the precise content of these meetings must remain confidential, until any decisions and changes can be communicated with supporters, the idea that fans are not involved and not at a decision making level, could not be further from the truth.  
  “The club is aware that, while the FAB is constructive and understands the realities, we are also challenging. We make our views known forcefully. We achieve real change. We work and will continue to work on the relationship.  
  “We are helped by two other enhancements to fan engagement.  
  “First of all, the club is doing much more work to survey a significant cross-section of the fanbase’s opinion. And sharing this work with the FAB. So far what we have learned has been well aligned with the advice we have been offering.  
  “Second, significantly more resources have been allocated to fan liaison than at any point in the club’s history. Before the FAB was created there was one part-time employee devoted to supporter liaison. There is now a department which will number four full-time members of staff. Contrary to what has been suggested, these facts give a full and proper picture of what is going on.  
  “Finally, we would like to add this.  
  “Chelsea’s men’s team is part way through a season with much to play for. We will soon return to Wembley. We want to rise up the table, with the European places in touching distances. We have exciting young players with real green shoots of improvement in the men’s first team following significant investment. In addition, our Women’s team continues to thrive domestically and on the European stage in Emma Hayes’ final season.  
  “Football is a matter of opinion and expressing emotion is part of that. But we have to get behind our team and make our contribution to victory rather than seek chaos and division through attacks and campaigns.  
  “Every Chelsea fan (including the ownership group) is frustrated at setbacks or results that don’t go our way. But the team and the club more broadly needs its supporters. The only people who benefit from Chelsea fans turning on Chelsea are fans of other clubs. If we’re pulling in the same direction then ‘every little thing gonna be alright’.”

  Chelsea FC, English professional football (soccer) team based in the Hammersmith and Fulham borough of London. Chelsea Football Club (FC), nicknamed “the Blues,” is one of the world’s richest, biggest, and most-supported football clubs. It is known for its star players and an offensive style of play.  
  Chelsea FC was founded in 1905 by Henry Augustus Mears. Home games are played at Stamford Bridge stadium, the original site Mears chose for the club. The team had mixed fortunes over the years, not winning a major trophy until the 1950s and moving up and down between divisions several times. The Blues improved their standing in the 1990s and the early 21st century to become one of the most successful clubs in English football. They won English Premier League titles in 2004–05 and 2005–06, adding to their only previous league win, in 1954–55 (then in the Football League First Division), and making them the second English team to win consecutive championships since the founding of the Premier League in 1992. Chelsea added a fourth league title in 2009–10, setting a new Premier League record by scoring 103 goals over the course of the season, and it won additional league championships in 2014–15 and 2016–17. It took the European Cup Winners’ Cup in 1971 and 1998 and the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Super Cup in 1998. In 2012 the club claimed its first Champions League title. Chelsea FC also won the Football Association Challenge Cup (FA Cup) eight times.  
  Despite Chelsea’s roller-coaster history, an array of notable players have performed with the club. Top stars from the 1960s onward have included Bobby Tambling, Jimmy Greaves, Terry Venables, John Hollins, Ray Wilkins, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba, Michael Essien, and Michael Ballack. On the downside, Chelsea fans include one of England’s most notorious gangs of football hooligans, known as the Headhunters; they have been responsible for organized violence in the stands since the 1970s, usually consisting of assaults on fans of other teams.  
  History  
  Founding and early years  
  In 1904, Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium in Fulham with the aim of turning it into a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham F.C. was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were also considered.[10] Chelsea F.C. was founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook),[1][11] opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.  
  Chelsea won promotion to the First Division in their second season, and yo-yoed between the First and Second Divisions in its early years. The team reached the 1915 FA Cup final, where they lost to Sheffield United at Old Trafford, and finished third in the First Division in 1920, the club's best league campaign to that point.[12] Chelsea had a reputation for signing star players[13] and attracted large crowds. The club had the highest average attendance in English football in ten separate seasons[14] including 1907–08,[15] 1909–10,[16] 1911–12,[17] 1912–13,[18] 1913–14[19] and 1919–20.[20][21] They were FA Cup semi-finalists in 1920 and 1932 and remained in the First Division throughout the 1930s, but success eluded the club in the inter-war years.  
  Modernisation and the first league championship  
  Former Arsenal and England centre-forward Ted Drake was appointed manager in 1952 and proceeded to modernise the club. He removed the club's Chelsea pensioner crest, improved the youth set-up and training regime, rebuilt the side with shrewd signings from the lower divisions and amateur leagues, and led Chelsea to their first major trophy success – the League championship – in 1954–55. The following season saw UEFA create the European Champions' Cup, but after objections from The Football League, Chelsea were persuaded to withdraw from the competition before it started.[22][23] Chelsea failed to build on this success, and spent the remainder of the 1950s in mid-table. Drake was dismissed in 1961 and replaced by player-coach Tommy Docherty.  
  Docherty built a new team around the group of talented young players emerging from the club's youth set-up, and Chelsea challenged for honours throughout the 1960s, enduring several near-misses. They were on course for a treble of League, FA Cup and League Cup going into the final stages of the 1964–65 season, winning the League Cup but faltering late on in the other two.[24] In three seasons the side were beaten in three major semi-finals and were FA Cup runners-up. Under Docherty's successor, Dave Sexton, Chelsea won the FA Cup in 1970, beating Leeds United 2–1 in a final replay. The following year, Chelsea took their first European honour, a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup triumph, with another replayed win, this time over Real Madrid in Athens.  
  Redevelopment and financial crisis  
  The late 1970s through to the '80s was a turbulent period for Chelsea. An ambitious redevelopment of Stamford Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club,[25] star players were sold and the team were relegated. Further problems were caused by a notorious hooligan element among the support, which was to plague the club throughout the decade.[26] In 1982, at the nadir of their fortunes, Chelsea were acquired by Ken Bates from Mears' great-nephew Brian Mears, for the nominal sum of £1. Bates bought a controlling stake in the club and floated Chelsea on the AIM stock exchange in March 1996[27] although by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property developers, meaning the club faced losing their home.[28] On the pitch, the team had fared little better, coming close to relegation to the Third Division for the first time, but in 1983 manager John Neal put together an impressive new team for minimal outlay. Chelsea won the Second Division title in 1983–84 and established themselves in the top division with two top-six finishes, before being relegated again in 1988. The club bounced back immediately by winning the Second Division championship in 1988–89.  
  After a long-running legal battle, Bates reunited the stadium freehold with the club in 1992 by doing a deal with the banks of the property developers, who had been bankrupted by a market crash.[29] In the mid-1990s Chelsea fan and businessman Matthew Harding became a director and loaned the club £26 million to build the new North Stand and invest in new players.[30] Chelsea's form in the new Premier League was unconvincing, although they did reach the 1994 FA Cup final. The appointment of Ruud Gullit as player-manager in 1996 began an upturn in the team's fortunes. He added several top international players to the side and led the club to their first major honour since 1971, the FA Cup. Gullit was replaced by Gianluca Vialli, whose reign saw Chelsea win the League Cup, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup in 1998, and the FA Cup in 2000. They also mounted a strong title challenge in 1998–99, finishing four points behind champions Manchester United, and made their first appearance in the UEFA Champions League. Vialli was sacked in favour of Claudio Ranieri, who guided Chelsea to the 2002 FA Cup final and Champions League qualification in 2002–03.  
  2003–2022: Abramovich era  
  "I don't want to throw my money away but it's really about having fun and that means success and trophies."  
  —Roman Abramovich, in an interview with the BBC following the takeover.[31]  
  With the club facing an apparent financial crisis,[32] Bates unexpectedly sold Chelsea F.C. in June 2003 for £60 million.[33] In so doing, he reportedly recognised a personal profit of £17 million on the club he had bought for £1 in 1982 (his stake had been diluted to just below 30% over the years). The club's new owner was Russian oligarch and billionaire Roman Abramovich, who also took on responsibility for the club's £80 million of debt, quickly paying some of it. Sergei Pugachev alleged Chelsea was bought on Putin's orders, an allegation Abramovich has denied.[34] Bates mentioned that Abramovich was in talks to buy Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur before he bought Chelsea in a deal sealed in a day.[35]  
  Over £100 million was spent on new players, but Ranieri was unable to deliver any trophies,[36] and was replaced by José Mourinho.[37] Under Mourinho, Chelsea became the fifth English team to win back-to-back league championships since the Second World War (2004–05 and 2005–06),[38] in addition to winning an FA Cup (2007) and two League Cups (2005 and 2007). After a poor start to the 2007–08 season, Mourinho was replaced by Avram Grant,[39] who led the club to their first UEFA Champions League final, which they lost on penalties to Manchester United. The club did not turn a profit in the first nine years of Abramovich's ownership, and made record losses of £140m in June 2005.[40]  
  I am a fan of special nature. I'm excited before every single game. The trophy at the end is less important than the process itself.  
  —Abramovich discussing two trophy-laden years at Chelsea (2006).[41]  
  In 2009, under caretaker manager Guus Hiddink, Chelsea won another FA Cup.[42] In 2009–10, his successor Carlo Ancelotti led them to their first Premier League and FA Cup Double, also becoming the first English top-flight club to score 100 league goals in a season since 1963.[43] In 2012, Roberto Di Matteo led Chelsea to their seventh FA Cup,[44] and their first UEFA Champions League title, beating Bayern Munich 4–3 on penalties, the first London club to win the trophy.[45] The following year the club won the UEFA Europa League,[46] making them the first club to hold two major European titles simultaneously and one of five clubs to have won the three main UEFA trophies.[47] Mourinho returned as manager in 2013 and led Chelsea to League Cup success in March 2015,[48] and the Premier League title two months later.[49] Mourinho was sacked after four months of the following season after a poor start.[50]  
  In November 2012, Chelsea announced a profit of £1.4 million for the year ending 30 June 2012, the first time the club had made a profit under Abramovich's ownership.[40][51] This was followed by a loss in 2013 and then their highest ever profit of £18.4 million for the year to June 2014.[52] In 2018 Chelsea announced a record after-tax profit of £62 million.[53]  
  In 2017, under new coach Antonio Conte, Chelsea won their sixth English title and the following season won their eighth FA Cup.[54] In 2018 Conte was sacked after a fifth-place finish and replaced with Maurizio Sarri,[55][56] under whom Chelsea reached the League Cup final, which they lost on penalties to Manchester City[57] and won the Europa League for a second time, beating Arsenal 4–1 in the final. Sarri then left the club to become manager of Juventus and was replaced by former Chelsea player Frank Lampard.[58]  
  In Lampard's first season he guided Chelsea to fourth place in the Premier League and reached the FA Cup final, losing 2–1 to Arsenal.[59] Lampard was dismissed in January 2021 and replaced with Thomas Tuchel.[60][61]  
  On 18 April 2021, Chelsea announced it would be joining a new European Super League, a league competition comprising the biggest European clubs.[65] After a backlash from supporters, the club announced their withdrawal days later.[66] The club opted against furloughing their non-matchday staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the decision reportedly coming from Abramovich himself. Chelsea, one of the first clubs to help the National Health Service, lent the club-owned Millennium Hotel for the NHS staff.[67]  
  "[Chelsea] have been a success machine for the last 10–20 years. That doesn't just come with money, we've seen at Manchester United and Arsenal where they've put billions into the team and not had the success that Chelsea have had. Chelsea can feel comfortable that they'll have rich owners, but will they have football-smart owners? Because that's what Abramovich has been.  
  Amidst financial sanctions leveled at Russian oligarchs by Western governments in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Abramovich stated on 26 February that he would hand over the stewardship of Chelsea to the trustees of the Chelsea Foundation.[69] The trustees did not immediately agree, due to legal concerns regarding the rules of the Charity Commission for England and Wales.[70] A week later, Abramovich wrote-off the £1.5 billion the club owed him, and put the club up for sale, pledging to donate net proceeds from it to the victims of the war in Ukraine.[71][72]  
  On 10 March 2022, the British government announced sanctions on Abramovich with Chelsea allowed to operate under a special license until 31 May.[73][74] In the following weeks, reports emerged of Abramovich's involvement in brokering a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia and securing safe evacuation corridors in besieged Ukrainian cities.[75][76] An American government official revealed that the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy had requested that the US government not levy sanctions against Abramovich given his importance to war relief efforts.[77]  
  2022–present: BlueCo era  
  We're all in – 100% – every minute of every match. Our vision as owners is clear: we want to make the fans proud.  
  —Todd Boehly, addressing the press after the takeover.[78]  
  On 7 May 2022, Chelsea confirmed that terms have been agreed for a new ownership group, led by Todd Boehly, Clearlake Capital, Mark Walter and Hansjörg Wyss, to acquire the club. The group was later known as BlueCo.[79] The UK government approved the £4.25bn takeover,[80] ending Abramovich's 19-year ownership of the club.[81] Bruce Buck, who served as chairman since 2003, was replaced by Boehly,[82] while long-serving club director and de facto sporting director Marina Granovskaia left,[83] as did Petr Čech from the role of technical and performance advisor.[84]  
  Chelsea won six of the first 11 games of the 2022–23 season, but only five of the remaining 27. The club scored a record-low 38 goals across the entire season and finished in the bottom half of the table for the first time since 1995–96.[85]  
  L1 = Level 1 of the football league system; L2 = Level 2 of the football league system  
  Stadium  
  Chelsea have only had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, where they have played since the team's foundation. The stadium was officially opened on 28 April 1877 and for the next 28 years it was used by the London Athletic Club as an arena for athletics meetings. In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman Gus Mears and his brother Joseph, who had also purchased nearby land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5 acre (51,000 m2) site.[86] Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect Archibald Leitch, who had also designed Ibrox, Craven Cottage and Hampden Park.[87] Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.  
  Starting with an open bowl-like design and one grandstand with seating, Stamford Bridge had an original capacity of around 100,000, making it the second biggest stadium in England after Crystal Palace.[86] The early 1930s saw the construction of a terrace on the southern part of the ground with a roof that covered around 20% of the stand. As the roof resembled that of a corrugated iron shed, the stand eventually became known as the "Shed End", although it is unknown who first coined this name. From the 1960s, it became known as the home of Chelsea's most loyal and vocal supporters.[86] In 1939, another small seated stand was added, the North Stand, which remained until its demolition in 1975.[86]  
  In the early 1970s, the club's owners announced a modernisation of Stamford Bridge with plans for a state-of-the-art 50,000 all-seater stadium.[86] Work began in 1972 but the project was beset with problems and ultimately only the East Stand was completed; the cost brought the club close to bankruptcy. The freehold was sold to property developers and the club were under threat of eviction from the stadium.[86] Following a long legal battle, it was not until the mid-1990s that Chelsea's future at Stamford Bridge was secured and renovation work resumed.[86] The north, west and southern parts of the ground were converted into all-seater stands and moved closer to the pitch, a process completed by 2001. The East Stand was retained from the 1970s development. In 1996, the north stand was renamed the Matthew Harding stand, after the club director and benefactor who was killed in a helicopter crash earlier that year.[88]  
  When Stamford Bridge was redeveloped in the Bates era many additional features were added to the complex including two Millennium & Copthorne hotels, apartments, bars, restaurants, the Chelsea Megastore, and an interactive visitor attraction called Chelsea World of Sport. The intention was that these facilities would provide extra revenue to support the football side of the business, but they were less successful than hoped and before the Abramovich takeover in 2003 the debt taken on to finance them was a major burden on the club. Soon after the takeover a decision was taken to drop the "Chelsea Village" brand and refocus on Chelsea as a football club. However, the stadium is sometimes still referred to as part of "Chelsea Village" or "The Village".  
  The Stamford Bridge freehold, the pitch, the turnstiles and Chelsea's naming rights are now owned by Chelsea Pitch Owners, a non-profit organisation in which fans are the shareholders. The CPO was created to ensure the stadium could never again be sold to developers. As a condition for using the Chelsea FC name, the club has to play its first team matches at Stamford Bridge, which means that if the club moves to a new stadium, they may have to change their name.[89] Chelsea's training ground is located in Cobham, Surrey. Chelsea moved to Cobham in 2004. Their previous training ground in Harlington was taken over by QPR in 2005.[90] The new training facilities in Cobham were completed in 2007.[91]  
  The previous owner Abramovich and the club's then executive board determined that a larger stadium is necessary in order for Chelsea to stay competitive with rival clubs who have significantly larger stadia, such as Arsenal and Manchester United.[102] Owing to its location next to a main road and two railway lines, fans can only enter Stamford Bridge via the Fulham Road, which places constraints on expansion due to health and safety regulations.[103] The club have consistently affirmed their desire to keep Chelsea at their current home,[104][105] but have nonetheless been linked with a move to various nearby sites, including the Earls Court Exhibition Centre, Battersea Power Station and the Chelsea Barracks.[106] In October 2011, a proposal from the club to buy back the freehold to the land on which Stamford Bridge sits was voted down by Chelsea Pitch Owners shareholders.[107] In May 2012, the club made a formal bid to purchase Battersea Power Station, with a view to developing the site into a new stadium,[108] but lost out to a Malaysian consortium.[109] The club subsequently announced plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge into a 60,000-seater stadium,[110] and in January 2017 these plans were approved by Hammersmith and Fulham council.[111] However, on 31 May 2018, the club released a statement saying that the new stadium project had been put on hold indefinitely, citing "the current unfavourable investment climate."[112]  
  In July 2022, it was reported that the club's new owner Todd Boehly had appointed American architect Janet Marie Smith to oversee the renovation of the stadium.[113]  
  Identity  
  Crest  
  Chelsea has had four main crests, which all underwent minor variations. The first, adopted when the club was founded, was the image of a Chelsea Pensioner, the army veterans who reside at the nearby Royal Hospital Chelsea. This contributed to the club's original "pensioner" nickname, and remained for the next half-century, though it never appeared on the shirts. When Ted Drake became Chelsea manager in 1952, he began to modernise the club. Believing the Chelsea pensioner crest to be old-fashioned, he insisted that it be replaced.[114] A stop-gap badge which comprised the initials C.F.C. was adopted for a year. In 1953, the club crest was changed to an upright blue lion looking backwards and holding a staff. It was based on elements in the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea[115] with the "lion rampant regardant" taken from the arms of then club president Viscount Chelsea and the staff from the Abbots of Westminster, former Lords of the Manor of Chelsea. It also featured three red roses, to represent England, and two footballs.[114] This was the first Chelsea crest to appear on the shirts, in the early 1960s. In 1975, a heraldic badge was granted by the College of Arms to the English Football League for use by Chelsea. The badge took the form of the familiar lion and staff encircled by a blue ring but without lettering and without the red roses and red footballs (blazoned as "A lion rampant reguardant azure supporting with the forepaws a crozier or all within an annulet azure").[116] In 1986, with Ken Bates owner of the club, Chelsea's crest was changed again as part of another attempt to modernise and because the old rampant lion badge could not be trademarked.[117] The new badge featured a more naturalistic non-heraldic lion, in white and not blue, standing over the C.F.C. initials. This lasted for the next 19 years, with some modifications such as the use of different colours, including red from 1987 to 1995, and yellow from 1995 until 1999, before the white returned.[118] With the new ownership of Roman Abramovich, and the club's centenary approaching, combined with demands from fans for the popular 1950s badge to be restored, it was decided that the crest should be changed again in 2005. The new crest was officially adopted for the start of the 2005–06 season and marked a return to the older design, used from 1953 to 1986, featuring a blue heraldic lion holding a staff. For the centenary season this was accompanied by the words '100 Years' and 'Centenary 2005–2006' on the top and bottom of the crest respectively.[119]  
  Colours  
  Chelsea's first home colours (1905 – c. 1912)[120]  
  Chelsea have always worn blue shirts, although they originally used the paler eton blue, which was taken from the racing colours of then club president, Earl Cadogan, and was worn with white shorts and dark blue or black socks.[121] The light blue shirts were replaced by a royal blue version in around 1912.[122] In the 1960s Chelsea manager Tommy Docherty changed the kit again, switching to blue shorts (which have remained ever since) and white socks, believing it made the club's colours more modern and distinctive, since no other major side used that combination; this kit was first worn during the 1964–65 season.[123] Since then Chelsea have always worn white socks with their home kit apart from a short spell from 1985 to 1992, when blue socks were reintroduced.  
  Chelsea's away colours are usually all yellow or all white with blue trim. More recently, the club have had a number of black or dark blue away kits which alternate every year.[124] As with most teams, they have also had some more unusual ones. At Docherty's behest, in the 1966 FA Cup semi-final they wore blue and black stripes, based on Inter Milan's kit.[125] In the mid-1970s, the away strip was a red, white and green kit inspired by the Hungarian national side of the 1950s.[126] Other away kits include an all jade strip worn from 1986 to 1989, red and white diamonds from 1990 to 1992, graphite and tangerine from 1994 to 1996, and luminous yellow from 2007 to 2008.[124] The graphite and tangerine strip has appeared in lists of the worst football kits ever.[127]  
  Chelsea released the song "No One Can Stop Us Now" in 1994 for reaching the 1994 FA Cup final. It reached number 23 in the UK Singles Chart.[131] In the build-up to the 1997 FA Cup final, the song "Blue Day", performed by Suggs and members of the Chelsea squad, reached number 22 in the UK chart.[132] In 2000, Chelsea released the song "Blue Tomorrow". It reached number 22 in the UK Singles Chart.[131]  
  At matches, Chelsea fans sing chants such as "Carefree" (to the tune of "Lord of the Dance", whose lyrics were probably written by supporter Mick Greenaway),[133][134] "Ten Men Went to Mow", "We All Follow the Chelsea" (to the tune of "Land of Hope and Glory"), "Zigga Zagga", and the celebratory "Celery". The latter is often accompanied by fans throwing celery at each other, although the vegetable was banned inside Stamford Bridge after an incident involving midfielder Cesc Fàbregas at the 2007 League Cup final.[135] Popular fan chants include, "Super Chelsea", "Super Frank" (dedicated to all-time leading goal scorer Frank Lampard), "We love you Chelsea" and "Come on Chelsea". There also some situation specific or team specific chants meant to rile up opposition teams, managers or players.[136]  
  Support  
  Chelsea is among the most widely supported football clubs in the world.[137][138] It has the sixth-highest average attendance in the history of English football,[139] and regularly attract over 40,000 fans to Stamford Bridge; they were the seventh best-supported Premier League team in the 2013–14 season, with an average gate of 41,572.[140] Chelsea's traditional fanbase comes from all over the Greater London area including working-class parts such as Hammersmith and Battersea, wealthier areas like Chelsea and Kensington, and from the home counties. There are also numerous official supporters clubs in the United Kingdom and all over the world.[141] Between 2007 and 2012, Chelsea were ranked fourth worldwide in annual replica kit sales, with an average of 910,000.[142] As of 2023, Chelsea has 118.9 million followers on social media, the fourth highest among football clubs.[143]  
  During the 1970s and 1980s in particular, Chelsea supporters were associated with football hooliganism. The club's "football firm", originally known as the Chelsea Shed Boys, and subsequently as the Chelsea Headhunters, were nationally notorious for football violence, alongside hooligan firms from other clubs such as West Ham United's Inter City Firm and Millwall's Bushwackers, before, during and after matches.[144] The increase of hooligan incidents in the 1980s led chairman Ken Bates to propose erecting an electric fence to deter them from invading the pitch, a proposal that the Greater London Council rejected.[145]  
  Since the 1990s, there has been a marked decline in crowd trouble at matches, as a result of stricter policing, CCTV in grounds and the advent of all-seater stadia.[146] In 2007, the club launched the Back to the Shed campaign to improve the atmosphere at home matches, with notable success. According to Home Office statistics, 126 Chelsea fans were arrested for football-related offences during the 2009–10 season, the third highest in the division, and 27 banning orders were issued, the fifth-highest in the division.[147]  
  A 2004 survey by Planetfootball.com found that Chelsea fans consider their main rivalries to be with (in descending order): Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United. In the same survey, fans of Arsenal, Fulham, Leeds United, QPR, Tottenham, and West Ham United named Chelsea as one of their three main rivals.[154] In a 2008 poll conducted by the Football Fans Census, Chelsea fans named Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United as their most disliked clubs. In the same survey, "Chelsea" was the top answer to the question "Which other English club do you dislike the most?"[155] A 2012 survey, conducted among 1,200 supporters of the top four league divisions across the country, found that many clubs' main rivals had changed since 2003 and reported that Chelsea fans consider Tottenham to be their main rivals, above Arsenal and Manchester United. Additionally, fans of Arsenal, Brentford, Fulham, Liverpool, Manchester United, QPR, Tottenham and West Ham identified Chelsea as one of their top three rivals.[156]  
  Records and statistics  
  Chelsea's highest appearance-maker is ex-captain Ron Harris, who played in 795 competitive games for the club between 1961 and 1980.[157] Five other players made more than 500 appearances for the club: Peter Bonetti (729; 1959–79), John Terry (717; 1998–2017), Frank Lampard (648; 2001–2014), John Hollins (592; 1963–1975 and 1983–1984), and César Azpilicueta (508; 2012–2023).[158] With 103 caps (101 while at the club) for England, Lampard is Chelsea's most capped international player. Every starting player in Chelsea's 57 games of the 2013–14 season was a full international – a new club record.[159]  
  Lampard is Chelsea's all-time top goalscorer, having scored 211 goals in 648 games (2001–2014);[157] he passed Bobby Tambling's longstanding record of 202 in May 2013.[160] Eight other players have also scored over 100 goals for Chelsea: George Hilsdon (1906–1912), George Mills (1929–1939), Roy Bentley (1948–1956), Jimmy Greaves (1957–1961), Peter Osgood (1964–1974 and 1978–1979), Kerry Dixon (1983–1992), Didier Drogba (2004–2012 and 2014–2015), and Eden Hazard (2012–2019). Greaves holds the club record for the most goals scored in one season (43 in 1960–61).[161] While a Chelsea player, Greaves also became the youngest ever player to score 100 goals in the English top-flight, at 20 years and 290 days.[162]  
  From 20 March 2004 to 26 October 2008, Chelsea went a record 86 consecutive league matches at home without defeat, beating the previous record of 63 matches unbeaten set by Liverpool between 1978 and 1980.[170][171] Chelsea hold the English record for the fewest goals conceded during a league season (15), the highest number of clean sheets overall in a Premier League season (25) (both set during the 2004–05 season),[172] and the most consecutive clean sheets from the start of a league season (6, set during the 2005–06 season).[173] Chelsea is the only Premier League side to have won its opening nine league games of the season, doing so in 2005–06.[174][175] From 2009 to 2013, Chelsea were unbeaten in a record 29 consecutive FA Cup matches (excluding penalty shoot-outs).[176]  
  On 25 August 1928, Chelsea, along with Arsenal, became the first club to play with shirt numbers, in their match against Swansea Town.[177] They were the first English side to travel by aeroplane to a domestic away match, when they visited Newcastle United on 19 April 1957,[178] and the first First Division side to play a match on a Sunday, when they faced Stoke City on 27 January 1974. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first British side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up (no British or Irish players) in a Premier League match against Southampton.[179] In May 2007, Chelsea were the first team to win the FA Cup at the new Wembley Stadium, having also been the last to win it at the old Wembley.[180] They were the first English club to be ranked No. 1 under UEFA's five-year coefficient system in the 21st century.[181] They were the first Premier League team, and the first team in the English top flight since 1962–63, to score at least 100 goals in a single season, reaching the milestone during the 2009–10 season.[43] Chelsea is the only London club to have won the UEFA Champions League.[182][183] Upon winning the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League, Chelsea became the first English club to win all four UEFA club trophies and the only club to hold the Champions League and the Europa League at the same time.[184]  
  On 12 February 2022, Chelsea became the first London club to win the FIFA Club World Cup against Palmeiras with Kai Havertz scoring a late penalty.[190] Chelsea broke the spending record in the winter transfer window with a £289 million spending spree on eight new signings, with the £107 million signing of Enzo Fernandez breaking the British transfer record.[191]  
  Ownership and finances  
  Chelsea Football Club was founded by Gus Mears in 1905. After his death in 1912, his descendants continued to own the club until 1982, when Ken Bates bought the club from Mears' great-nephew Brian Mears for £1. Bates bought a controlling stake in the club and floated Chelsea on the AIM stock exchange in March 1996.[27] In the mid-1990s Chelsea fan and businessman Matthew Harding became a director, and loaned the club £26 million to build the new North Stand and invest in new players.[30]  
  In July 2003, Roman Abramovich purchased just over 50% of Chelsea Village plc's share capital, including Bates' 29.5% stake, for £30 million and over the following weeks bought out most of the remaining 12,000 shareholders at 35 pence per share, completing a £140 million takeover. Other shareholders at the time of the takeover included the Matthew Harding estate (21%), BSkyB (9.9%) and various anonymous offshore trusts.[192]  
  At the time of the Abramovich takeover, the club also had debts of around £100 million, which included a 10-year £75 million Eurobond taken out in 1997 by the Bates regime to buy the freehold of Stamford Bridge and finance the redevelopment of the stadium. The 9% interest on the loan cost the club around £7 million a year and according to Bruce Buck, Chelsea were struggling to pay an instalment due in July 2003.[193] Abramovich paid off some of that debt immediately, but the outstanding £36 million on the Eurobond was not fully repaid until 2008.[194] Since then, the club had no external debt.[195]  
  Abramovich changed the ownership name to Chelsea FC plc, whose ultimate parent company was Fordstam Limited, which was controlled by him.[196] Chelsea were additionally funded by Abramovich via interest free soft loans channelled through his holding company Fordstam Limited. The loans stood at £709 million in December 2009, when they were all converted to equity by Abramovich, leaving the club themselves debt free,[197][198] although the debt remained with Fordstam.[199]  
  Chelsea did not turn a profit in the first nine years of Abramovich's ownership, and made record losses of £140m in June 2005.[40] In November 2012, Chelsea announced a profit of £1.4 million for the year ending 30 June 2012, the first time the club had made a profit under Abramovich's ownership.[40][51] This was followed by a loss in 2013 and then their highest ever profit of £18.4 million for the year to June 2014.[52] In 2018 Chelsea announced a record after-tax profit of £62 million.[53]  
  Chelsea has been described as a global brand; a 2012 report by Brand Finance ranked Chelsea fifth among football brands and valued the club's brand value at US$398 million – an increase of 27% from the previous year, also valuing it at US$10 million more than the sixth best brand, London rivals Arsenal – and gave the brand a strength rating of AA (very strong).[200][201] In 2016, Forbes magazine ranked Chelsea the seventh most valuable football club in the world, at £1.15 billion ($1.66 billion).[202] As of 2016[update], Chelsea was ranked eighth in the Deloitte Football Money League with an annual commercial revenue of £322.59 million.[203]  
  As of May 2022, Chelsea was ranked the eighth-most valuable club in the world according to Forbes,[204] and also eighth according to Deloitte, with an annual commercial revenue of €493.1 million.[205]  
  The club's recent accounting records highlight £26.6m they lost in compensation to former head coach Antonio Conte for sacking and to pay off his backroom staff and the legal costs that followed.[206]  
  On 26 February 2022, during the Russo-Ukrainian War, Abramovich handed over "stewardship and care" of Chelsea FC to the Chelsea Charitable Foundation.[207] Abramovich released an official statement on 2 March 2022 confirming that he was selling the club due to the ongoing situation in Ukraine.[208] Although the UK government froze Abramovich's assets in United Kingdom on 10 March due to his "close ties with Kremlin", it was made clear that the Chelsea club will be allowed to operate in terms of activities which are football related.[209] On 12 March, the Premier League disqualified Abramovich as a director of Chelsea Football Club.[210]  
  On 19 March 2022, there were five confirmed bids to acquire Chelsea FC: submitted to Raine Capital which was handling the sale of the club. Some of these were a consortium led by ex-Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton, a group of investors led by the Ricketts family (among them Joe and Pete Ricketts), Swiss and American businessmen Hansjörg Wyss and Todd Boehly, Aethel Partners headed by Portuguese Ricardo Santos Silva and British businessman Nick Candy, supported by former Chelsea striker Gianluca Vialli.[211]  
  On 7 May, the club finally confirmed that "terms have been agreed" for a new ownership group led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital.[212] On 30 May, it was confirmed that the Boehly consortium had completed the purchase of the club.[213] The consortium also includes Wyss and Mark Walter. Walter and Boehly are also owners of the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Los Angeles Lakers, and the Los Angeles Sparks. The consortium was later known as BlueCo. The transaction had received all necessary approvals from the governments of the United Kingdom and, the Premier League, and other authorities.[214][215]  
  Sponsorship  
  Chelsea's kit has been manufactured by Nike since July 2017. Previously, the kit was manufactured by Adidas, which was originally contracted to supply the club's kit from 2006 to 2018. The partnership was extended in October 2010 in a deal worth £160 million over eight years.[216] This deal was again extended in June 2013 in a deal worth £300 million over another 10 years.[217] In May 2016, Adidas announced that by mutual agreement, the kit sponsorship would end six years early on 30 June 2017.[218] Chelsea had to pay £40m in compensation to Adidas. In October 2016, Nike was announced as the new kit sponsor, in a deal worth £900m over 15 years, until 2032.[219] Previously, the kit was manufactured by Umbro (1975–81), Le Coq Sportif (1981–86), The Chelsea Collection (1986–87), Umbro (1987–2006), and Adidas (2006–2017).  
  Chelsea's first shirt sponsor was Gulf Air, agreed during the 1983–84 season. The club was then sponsored by Grange Farms, Bai Lin Tea and Simod before a long-term deal was signed with Commodore International in 1989; Amiga, an offshoot of Commodore, also appeared on the shirts. Chelsea was subsequently sponsored by Coors beer (1994–97), Autoglass (1997–2001), Emirates (2001–05), Samsung Mobile (2005–08), Samsung (2008–15)[220][221] and Yokohama Tyres (2015–20). From July 2020, Chelsea's sponsor was Three;[222] however, it temporarily suspended its sponsorship in March 2022 in response to sanctions leveled by the UK government against Abramovich.[223] It restored its sponsorship after the change of ownership of the club.[224]  
  Following the introduction of sleeve sponsors in the Premier League, Chelsea had Alliance Tyres as its first sleeve sponsor in the 2017–18 season,[225] followed by Hyundai Motor Company in 2018-19 season.[226] In 2022–23 season, Amber Group became the new sleeve sponsor, with the flagship digital asset platform WhaleFin appearing on the sleeves of both men's and women's teams.[227]  
  Up until the 1950s, the club had a long-running association with the music halls; their underachievement often provided material for comedians such as George Robey.[235] It culminated in comedian Norman Long's release of a comic song in 1933, ironically titled "On the Day That Chelsea Went and Won the Cup", the lyrics of which describe a series of bizarre and improbable occurrences on the hypothetical day when Chelsea finally won a trophy.[13] In Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 film The 39 Steps, Mr Memory claims that Chelsea last won the Cup in 63 BC, "in the presence of the Emperor Nero."[236] Scenes in a 1980 episode of Minder were filmed during a real match at Stamford Bridge between Chelsea and Preston North End with Terry McCann (Dennis Waterman) standing on the terraces.[237]

  Chelsea Women  
  Chelsea also operate a women's football team, Chelsea Football Club Women, formerly known as Chelsea Ladies. They have been affiliated to the men's team since 2004[242] and are part of the club's Community Development programme. They play their home games at Kingsmeadow, formerly the home ground of the EFL League Two club AFC Wimbledon. The club were promoted to the Premier Division for the first time in 2005 as Southern Division champions and won the Surrey County Cup nine times between 2003 and 2013.[243] In 2010, Chelsea Ladies were one of the eight founder members of the FA Women's Super League.[244] In 2015, Chelsea Ladies won the FA Women's Cup for the first time, beating Notts County Ladies at Wembley Stadium,[245] and a month later clinched their first FA WSL title to complete a league and cup double.[246] In 2018, they won a second league and FA Cup double.[247] Two years later, in 2020, they repeated their double success by winning the third league title and the FA Women's League Cup for the first time.[248][249] In the 2020–21 season, Chelsea won a domestic treble by winning the league, FA Cup and League Cup.[250] They also reached the final of the UEFA Women's Champions League for the first time, losing to Barcelona 4–0.[251]  
  John Terry, former captain of the Chelsea men's team, is the president of Chelsea Women.[252]

  Chelsea vs Burnley: Prediction, kick-off time, TV, live stream, team news, h2h results, odds  
  Chelsea will look to show they have turned a corner for what feels like the umpteenth time when they host Burnley on Saturday.  
  Stuck in 11th place in the Premier League table, the Blues have won two, drawn two and lost two of their last six league games while enjoying some respite of-sorts in the cups.  
  Having conceded twice in each of their last four games, yet still managing to win three of them and draw the other, Mauricio Pochettino will hope his side can show a bit more control against Burnley.  
  The Clarets beat Brentford last time out to go within five points of safety amid the points-deduction sagas going on above them.  
  But their dreadful record against Chelsea over the years has not abated despite the capital club’s recent decline.  
  Date, kick-off time and venue  
  Chelsea vs Burnley is scheduled for a 3pm GMT kick-off on Saturday, March 30, 2024.  
  The match will take place at Stamford Bridge in west London.

  Where to watch Chelsea vs Burnley  
  TV channel: In the UK, the game will not be televised live as it lands during the 3pm Saturday blackout.  
  Free highlights: The Sky Sports app and YouTube channel will show highlights from 5.15pm with Match of the Day broadcasting on BBC One at 10.30pm.  
  Live blog: You can follow all the action on matchday via Standard Sport’s live blog, with expert analysis from our reporter Nizaar Kinsella at the ground.  
  Enzo Fernandez and Djordje Petrovic should return after sitting out the FA Cup win over Leicester, as both Raheem Sterling and Mykhailo Mudryk battle to keep their place in the line-up.  
  Loanee striker David Datro Fofana is ineligible for Burnley to face his parent club. Lyle Foster is most likely to replace him up front.  
  Vincent Kompany could keep faith with Arijanet Muric in goal after he replaced James Trafford for the win over Brentford before the break. Nathan Redmond and Aaron Ramsey are among those who will miss out due to injury.  
  Chelsea vs Burnley prediction  
  Fofana’s absence for Burnley deprives them of their chief attacking threat against a Chelsea team capable of scoring plenty of goals, but struggling to keep them out. Just like at Turf Moor, the Blues should be able to overpower the Clarets.  
  Chelsea to win, 3-1.

  Chelsea’s March Madness is almost over, with six wins out of six matches thus far this month. There are two more games left this week, and in the first of those, the Blues only need to manage the scoreline a bit, to make it past Ajax and into the Champions League semifinal.  
  Of course, winning is always our aim, but with the League Cup final against Arsenal coming up on Sunday, job number one in this game is simply to make good on our 3-0 lead from the first leg.  
  Date / Time: Wednesday, March 27, 2024, 20.00 GMT; 4pm EDT; 1:30am IST (next day) Venue: Stamford Bridge, SW6 Referee: Tess Olofsson (SWE) Forecast: Partly cloudy and a gentle breeze  
  On TV: TNT Sports 1, DAZN1 (UK); none (USA); elsewhere Streaming: discovery+, DAZN (UK); DAZN USA (USA)  
  Chelsea team news: This quarterfinal might look done and dusted thanks to our three-goal advantage from the first leg, manager Emma Hayes will surely think otherwise. Ajax have little to lose in coming to Stamford Bridge, and everything to gain. We will have to counter that by defending well and maintain the winning scoreline based on that foundation.  
  The grueling March schedule has led to a few extra injury issues, with Nathalie Björn getting ruled out once again, despite making the bench over the weekend. Fortunately, there was no such setback for Mayra Ramírez, who made a substitute appearance in that match after a short spell on the sidelines.  
  Ajax team news: All Ajax have to do is engineer one of the biggest comebacks in the history of this competition, but they showed their firepower in their last match, a 3-2 win over PEC Zwolle, with Romee Leuchter notching hat-trick. Our defence will need to mark her closely for sure!  
  Previously: Solid performance from Chelsea in Amsterdam, to give us the 3-0 first leg advantage.

  Chelsea flop Christian Pulisic joins list of AC Milan legends with history-making Serie A goal

  AC Milan has joined the ranks of Juventus and Inter Milan as the third Italian team to score a whopping 5,000 goals in Serie A - and it's a former Chelsea man who helped them achieve it.  
  Juventus and Inter Milan are the only other clubs to have achieved this amazing feat.  
  The Rossoneri have been on fire recently, going unbeaten in their last five matches. In their past 14 league games, Milan have gathered 33 points, with 10 wins and just one loss.  
  These impressive stats have helped Stefano Pioli's team climb to second place in Italy's top league. Christian Pulisic has been in top form during that run, scoring in his last four matches  
  According to Milan's stats, Pulisic made history when he helped his team take a 2-0 lead in their 3-1 win against Verona on Sunday. This was the club's 5,000th goal in the top league, with the American joining a list of club legends who have reached similar milestones.  
  On May 28, 1950, Gunnar Nordahl scored the club's 1,000th goal during a 6-2 victory against Roma. On May 31, 1964, Paolo Ferrario scored the 2,000th goal for the club, during a 4-2 win against Serie C side SPAL.  
  Daniele Massaro added his name to the history books with their 3,000th goal on December 8, 1991 against Turin. Kaka, the Milan legend, scored their 4,000th goal in a 3-0 victory over Genoa on August 26, 2007.  
  This win has put Stefano Pioli's team three points ahead of Juventus, who are second in the Serie A league table.  
  Even though the Milan derby is just over a month away, it won't spark any debates about who will lift the Scudetto as Inter are leading by 14 points.  
  However, this big match will be a true test of Pioli's team's strength, which seems to be growing under his guidance and Pulisic's development.

  The January transfer window may have slammed shut a couple of weeks ago but there's plenty of life left in the rumour mill. Victor Osimhen continues to be heavily linked with a move to Stamford Bridge, while the Blues expand their search for a new centre-forward.  
  Conor Gallagher still faces an uncertain future in west London despite his impressive performances lately. The Cobham graduate played a key role in Chelsea's clash against Manchester City at the weekend – and Mauricio Pochettino will be hoping for more of the same when the Blues face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday.  
  Jurgen Klopp will be eager to mark his final season at Anfield with a piece of silverware, so Chelsea have a great opportunity to spoil the fun. With that being said, football.london has taken a look at some of the biggest Chelsea stories on Thursday, February 22.  
  Kounde rules out Barcelona exit  
  Chelsea have been dealt a major blow to their hopes of finally signing Jules Kounde. The 25-year-old defender was once heavily linked with a move to Stamford Bridge before deciding to join Barcelona instead – and now he faces an uncertain future at the Camp Nou.  
  According to Spanish publication Mundo Deportivo, Kounde does not want to leave the Catalan side this summer despite pressure from higher-ups to raise funds. The report states that the Blues sent scouts to watch the France international at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium on Wednesday night.  
  Victor Osimhen was also on display as Napoli held Barcelona to a 1-1 draw. Mundo Deportivo add that Newcastle United and Arsenal have also been monitoring Kounde, who reportedly has an outrageous €1billion release clause in his contract.  
  football.london says: "Kounde would be a good addition to the Chelsea squad, but I'm no longer convinced that he is what Pochettino needs. If the Blues still operated a back-five then he'd be perfect in the right centre-back role but, due to his height, I can't see him working too well at the heart of a back-four."  
  Chelsea and PSG battle for Osimhen deal  
  Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain look set to lock horns over the signature of Victor Osimhen. The 25-year-old striker has been heavily linked with a move to Stamford Bridge for a while now as he continues to impress at Napoli.  
  According to Italian outlet Calciomercato, the Italian giants have given Osimhen an eye-watering €130million (£110m) price tag. The report states that the Blues and PSG are 'ready to pounce' ahead of the summer transfer window.  
  football.london understands that Chelsea wanted to sign Osimhen last summer, but the Italian giants were determined to hold onto their talisman – so Nicolas Jackson was signed from Villarreal instead. The west Londoners viewed the Nigeria international as somebody who could have solved the club's misfortune in front of goal but, without Champions League qualification, any bid to sign him proved difficult.  
  football.london says: "I think Osimhen will almost certainly leave Napoli in the summer. I'd love to see him at Chelsea, but, personally, anything over £80million for his signature is just too much for me. Very good striker, but I'm not blown away... yet. Nicolas Jackson has shown more than enough potential – he's more than capable."  
  'Next Hojlund' plan revealed  
  Marco Silva has encouraged Armando Broja to draw inspiration from Rasmus Hojlund. The on-loan Chelsea striker has struggled to impress since swapping Stamford Bridge for Craven Cottage in the January transfer window.  
  "You can see the talent and the quality," said the Fulham boss. "Since he arrived you can see that he’s a young striker and young players need time to adapt and understand the ideas. When they start to score they become more confident and I can see this in Hojlund.  
  "He is a really strong player when he attacks in behind and it’s clear for me that he has the capacity to have a very good run while he is at Manchester United. Let’s hope we can block and defend him well because he’s a good player."  
  football.london says: "Broja has the potential to, one day, grow into the ideal striker for Chelsea. Unfortunately for the Albanian, it's not quite worked out as he would have hoped since he returning from injury. I'd love to see him end the season well and really compete with Jackson for a place in the starting lineup..."

  Chelsea FC  
  While Chelsea were a reasonably consistent club for most of their history, people nowadays usually associate them with the football juggernaut they've become at the turn of the century; not much of a surprise, considering the club won the majority of their silverware in that period. Chelsea have won League titles, FA Cups and League Cups. They've also found success in Europe, becoming the only British club to win all three major UEFA trophies: the Cup Winners' Cup, the Champions League and the Europa League.

  Old photo of Stamford Bridge from 1910s.  
  History  
  Chelsea was founded in 1905 by Gus Mears, an English businessman who had earlier bought the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium with the plan of transforming it into a football ground. His original idea was to rent it to an existing club, but after a deal with Fulham FC was halted, he got the idea to start a new club.  
  The biggest team in the capital  
  Chelsea would quickly prove to be a hit with the local supporters and established itself as the biggest club in the capital. In the late 1910s, the club became the first in Britain with an average attendance over 40,000.  
  The huge attendance numbers made "The Pensioners", a nickname for the team, to one of the richest clubs in the country and made it possible to pay well reputed players. Chelsea become also home for the first non-British player in the Football League, the Danish Nils Middelboe, who arrived to the club in 1913.  
  Yet, the first five decades of the club's existence were not overly fruitful. The team would be in constant motion between Division 1 and Division 2. In their second decade of existence, however, they managed to reach the FA Cup final for the first time.  
  The Chelsea squad of 1947.  
  First league title  
  Their first League title in 1955 was a shock for everyone, especially considering the club had finished in the bottom half of the league for most of the previous seasons. This unexpected success was not enough to turn their fortunes around, however, and the club soon returned to mediocrity.  
  The mid-60s caught Chelsea at the height of their popularity, with many big-name celebrities becoming regular guests at Stamford Bridge. For the first time in their history, the club was seen as an actual contender. After securing their first League Cup in 1965, they followed it up with two more "firsts" by claiming an FA Cup in 1970 and a Cup Winners' Cup in 1971.  
  Debts and new ownership  
  As it turned out, those were their last trophies for a while; with many financial difficulties regarding the redevelopment of Stamford Bridge and the increased hooliganism among the club's fans, Chelsea soon found themselves in a precarious position. During the next couple of decades, Chelsea's on-field results were not much of a priority, as the club's officials were desperately fighting to avoid bankruptcy. The ownership of the Mears family was interrupted when the club was sold for the symbolic sum of £1 to the new owner Ken Bates in 1982.  
  Return to the spotlight  
  The club did not return to the spotlight until 1996 and the appointment of Ruud Gullit as player-manager. With the celebrated Dutchman at the helm and a strike force led by Italian internationals Gianluca Vialli and Gianfranco Zola, Chelsea were once again one of the most exciting clubs in English football. While the club did not manage to go all the way in the Premier League during this period, they did enjoy some Cup success with two FA Cup victories in 1997 and 2000 and a League Cup triumph in 1998. To top it off, they also claimed their second Cup Winners' Cup in 1998 by defeating Stuttgart 1-0 in the final. Chelsea was at this period a team hugely dominated by foreign players. A game on Boxing Day 1999 marked a new era in British league football, when the Chelsea side against Southampton consisted of the first "all-overseas XI". No British player was starting the match; the players were: Ed De Goey (Holland), Albert Ferrer (Spain), Frank Lebouef (France), Emerson Thome (Brazil), Dan Petrescu (Romania), Celestine Babayaro (Nigeria), Gus Poyet (Uruguay), Didier Deschamps (France), Roberto Di Matteo (Italy), Gabriele Ambrosetti (Italy) and Tore Andre Flo (Norway).  
  Russian billionaire becomes the club's new owner  
  In 2003, Chelsea's landscape changed forever when the club was sold to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich. The new owner immediately led Chelsea to an era of financial stability, paying off the majority of the club's debts and spending a then-unprecedented amount of money on star signings. Still, it wasn't until José Mourinho's arrival that all the pieces fell into place; under the controversial Portuguese manager, Chelsea won back-to-back Premier League titles in 2005 and 2006, as well as two League Cups in 2005 and 2007 and an FA Cup in 2007. Even after Mourinho had left the club due to a number of disagreements with Abramovich, Chelsea continued to be a dominant force in English football, winning one more league title, two FA Cups, a Champions League and a Europa League in the next six years. Chelsea had never previously won the European Cup/Champions League or UEFA Cup/Europe League. Chelsea line up in CL final 2012 v. Bayern Munich (5-4) Shortly after Mourinho's return in 2013, the club won another League Cup and their fifth league title. After a long period of weak performance, Chelsea sacked José Mourinho in 2015.  
  Due to the sanctions against Russian oligarchs during the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2022, Abramovich was disqualified as a director of Chelsea FC by the Premier League and the ownership shifted.

  Logo  
  Four distinctive logos have been in use during the club’s history. The first was introduced in 1905 and featured a Chelsea pensioner (a retired member of the British army). In 1952, a second badge was introduced with the initials on, but was replaced after a short time by a logo that contained the characteristic lion (the lion was from the Arms of Earl Cadogan, president of the club). The fourth logo that was dominated by the "CFC" initials was in action between 1986 and 2005. The third logo that had been abandon in 1986 would be reintroduced in a modernized version again in 2005.

  Chelsea teenager Kendry Paez is reportedly set to avoid serious punishment for attending a New York strip club while on international duty with Ecuador.  
  The 16-year-old was spotted at the club with fellow Ecuadorians Robert Arboleda, 32, and Gonzalo Plata, 23, the night before a friendly against Italy in New Jersey.  
  Chelsea agreed a deal to sign Paez in July 2023 and he will officially move across to west London in the summer of 2025 once his 18th birthday has passed.  
  It is thought the Blues will not punish Paez for his strip club trip – with The Telegraph reporting they are likely to leave it up to the Ecuador FA as well as Independiente del Valle – the side he’ll play for until he heads to Stamford Bridge.  
  Paez is set to be warned about the incident and reminded of his responsibilities by officials from his club and country but he will not be seriously punished.  
  The same cannot be said for Arboleda and Plata, who will face harsher punishments and could even be dropped by the national team, according to reports in Ecuador.  
  Paez was not seen handling money or consuming alcohol in the viral clip – unlike his older teammates – while peer pressure has also been considered as a factor.  
  Paez’s close circle reportedly believe the youngster will learn a valuable lesson from the experience and are left disappointed more senior players didn’t lead by example.

  Chelsea have confirmed midfielder Romeo Lavia has been ruled out for the remainder of the season.  
  The Belgium international has suffered a setback in his recovery from an injury he sustained against Crystal Palace in December.  
  The midfielder joined Chelsea in a £60million deal from Southampton last summer, rejecting Liverpool in the process.  
  However, he suffered a muscle injury after arriving at the club and an ankle injury kept him out until December.  
  Lavia made his club debut on the 27th December against Palace but he suffered an injury in the very same match.  
  Chelsea’s medical staff hoped Lavia would return this month, but his setback means he has been ruled out for the remainder of the campaign.  
  It’s a bitter blow for Mauricio Pochettino, who has had to contend with a depleted squad this term.  
  His side languish in the Premier League, but they are through to the semi-finals of the FA Cup where they will face Manchester City.

  Chelsea have several fitness doubts ahead of their clash with Burnley on Saturday. Manager Mauricio Pochettino was handed fresh concerns over some of his players during the international break.  
  It was announced by the Blues on Wednesday that midfielder Romeo Lavia will miss the remainder of the season after a setback in his recovery, having made only one appearance in the campaign. A club statement said: “Recent medical assessments have confirmed that Lavia, who sustained a significant thigh injury against Crystal Palace back in December, will not feature again this season.”  
  In terms of players on international duty, Cole Palmer did not feature in either England friendly but was pictured in training at Cobham alongside Malo Gusto, who recovered from the illness that kept him out of the France U21 squad. Chelsea announced that Carney Chukwuemeka had withdrawn from England U21 duty on Monday to work on his fitness as he looks to build on his recent goal against Leicester City.  
  Defender Levi Colwill has been ruled out of England contention due to a toe injury. When asked about the defender, Pochettino said: “We only found out after the [Brentford] game. We finished with two players who then couldn't train. Levi's problem is his toe.”  
  Fellow defender Reece James has endured another injury-hit campaign. The right-back is recovering from a hamstring issue and could return to action next month.  
  “We were talking and he has started his recovery, one day closer to being with the group,” Pochettino explained. “This is really positive and we're all positive around him, we are going to help.”  
  Centre-back Wesley Fofana has been a long-term absentee with an ACL injury and is not expected to feature this season, though he is back out on the grass. Young midfielder Lesley Ugochukwu joins him on the sidelines, having been out with a hamstring injury since December and with no timescale set for his possible return.  
  In attack, Christopher Nkunku has suffered a similarly frustrating campaign. The former RB Leipzig has picked up several injuries, limiting him to ten appearances in his debut season at Stamford Bridge.  
  "I think he suffered a problem in his hamstring and we will see in a few weeks if he can be again available,” the Chelsea boss said. “But yes, now he is doing recovery from Sunday. A little bit unlucky, bad luck because to suffer again another setback.  
  "It's always tough for a player that didn't play too much during the season that also came from the Bundesliga, from Germany, with some problems. He was so good in the pre-season. It is a difficult season for him. It is difficult to accept another injury and to delay to play more consistent."

  Chelsea’s 16-year-old wonderkid Kendry Paez to avoid serious punishment after attending strip club  
  Teenager, who will move to Chelsea after 18th birthday, was filmed in New York club with Ecuador team-mates ahead of friendly loss to Italy  
  Matt Law, Football News Correspondent 26 March 2024 • 6:11pm  
  Chelsea’s teenage wonderkid Kendry Paez is expected to avoid any serious punishment after being taken to a New York strip club by senior members of the Ecuador squad before the team’s defeat to Italy.  
  Paez, who is 16 years old, was filmed with 23-year-old Gonzalo Plata and 32-year-old Robert Arboleda in a strip club on the night before the friendly against Italy last Sunday.  
  Chelsea are likely to leave the matter in the hands of the Ecuador national federation and Independiente del Valle, the Ecuadorian club he will play for until he officially moves to Stamford Bridge after his 18th birthday.  
  It is expected that officials at both his country and current club will speak to Paez about the incident and remind him of his responsibilities, but it is likely to be the older players who receive the serious punishments.  
  Reports in Ecuador have claimed that those held responsible for the trip to the strip club could be dropped from the national team. While it is accepted that Paez was naive, his age and the pressure on him to follow the older players is expected to be taken into consideration.  
  It has also been noted that, unlike his seniors, Paez was not filmed handling any money and was not seen with any alcohol.  
  Those close to Paez believe this will represent a valuable lesson in his development and are disappointed with the failure of the senior Ecuador players to lead by example.  
  A source said: “The boy clearly looks uncomfortable on the film and he is not joining in with some of the things going on. He has made a mistake, but that mistake was to let the older players lead him.”  
  #Breaking: Leaked video shows that various Ecuador National team players were out partying in NYC before their 2-0 loss to Italy on Sunday..  
  The videos circulating also show Kendry Paez (16-year-old) attending an adult nightclub with his fellow teammates.#Players involved are:… pic.twitter.com/9yRauu0dMn  
  The legal age to drink and attend strip clubs in America is 21. There is no suggestion Paez lied about his age to gain entry to the club.  
  Chelsea signed Paez, rated one of the top young prospects in the world, for £17.27 million from Independiente del Valle, with an agreement that the youngster will join on his 18th birthday – May 4 next year.  
  He visited England last December to train and watch Chelsea with more trips in the pipeline, but he will continue to play for Independiente until he can formally complete his big-money move.  
  Chelsea’s £115 million record signing Moises Caicedo was filmed in a different nightclub on the night after the Ecuador game and did not break any rules.  
  In a statement, the Ecuador federation said: “Given the facts of public knowledge, the FEF expresses the following: The official delegation had free time on Friday, March 22, from 2pm to 8.30pm, a schedule that was fully complied with.  
  “Images of events contrary to the values and principles that we defend and promote as an institution have been disseminated, which will be the subject of analysis for future calls. We reiterate our commitment to Ecuadorian soccer.”  
  Club History  
  Chelsea’s club history stretches back to April 1905 and is filled with ups and downs as one of England’s most successful football clubs. The Blues have also won many European trophies.  
  Club name  
  The name Chelsea Football Club dates back to 1904 when Henry Augustus ‘Gus’ Mears and his brother, Joseph Theophilus, obtained the deeds for Stamford Bridge. They initially sought to lease the venue but Fulham rejected their offer. So, the pair founded a team of their own.  
  Alongside Tom Lewin Kinton and John Henry Maltby, the Mears brothers founded Chelsea on April 20, 1905. The group would also decide to name their club after the adjacent borough of Chelsea. But they also considered using Stamford Bridge FC, London FC and Kensington FC.  
  Chelsea badge  
  Chelsea have used their fair share of badges throughout the club’s history with their current design the Blues’ 11th permanent crest. The Stamford Bridge outfit also used a special crest for the 2005/06 season. Their 100th-anniversary design also formed their badge as it is now.  
  Additionally, Chelsea’s badge for the 2005/06 term marked a return to the club’s crest from 1953 to 1964 in most. The Blues modernised their former badge and have continued to use the crest without the centenary branding since. It also saw the lion return to a central area.  
  The first badge in the club’s history featured a portrait of a Chelsea Pensioner at the core of a circle. But the Blues adopted a shield with the letters ‘CFC’ superimposed onto each other in the 1950s. Ted Drake had sought to disassociate the club with their Pensioners nickname.  
  Yet the shield only lasted the 1952/53 season before Chelsea returned to a circular badge. It was also their first badge to feature a lion holding a staff underneath five red roses. But Ken Bates’ arrival saw the west London outfit adopt only the letters ‘CFC’ as their badge in 1964.  
  Their simple lettered design remained Chelsea’s badge until 1967 when the club moved to a lion standing over ‘CFC’. The Blues would continue with it until 1986 when they introduced the first design to feature a lion straddling the two Cs that make up their abbreviated name.  
  Chelsea introduced and removed the circular outline of the badge off and on until 2005/06. The club also altered the colours used with the lion appearing in red, yellow and white. The Stamford Bridge natives also rotated between various shades of blue when using the circle.  
  Kit history  
  Only the first year in Chelsea’s history as a football club has seen the west Londoners play in anything but a blue kit. The club first adopted green jerseys with white shorts but embraced their now traditional colours in 1906. They would also embrace blue for their shorts in 1964.  
  League history  
  Chelsea have only ever played in the top two tiers of the English football league pyramid in their history. The Blues first entered a division for the 1905/06 season after entering the EFL straight after their formation. Yet it would only take two seasons to secure a top-flight berth.  
  Promotion into Division One brought three campaigns as a top-flight team and Chelsea have often remained in the top tier. Only from 1910-12, 1924-30, 1962-63, 1975-77, 1979-84 and 1988-89 have Chelsea played outside the top-flight since their first two terms in existence.  
  Thus Chelsea are also one of the ever-present sides in the Premier League having joined the breakaway division for its inaugural season in 1992/93. The Blues have since become one of the dominant outfits with five Premier League titles alongside their sole Division One crown.  
  Chelsea trophies  
  Chelsea had only lifted one top-flight trophy in the club’s history during the Division One era before entering the Premier League. The Blues triumphed in 1954/55 with 52 points from 42 games following just 20 wins. Three teams ended the term with 48 points as the runners-up.  
  Yet the Stamford Bridge natives have won the Premier League title five times, most recently in 2016/17. Jose Mourinho oversaw their maiden crown in 2004/05 following the vast sums of cash that Roman Abramovich invested. They would also defend their title during 2005/06.  
  Carlo Ancelotti later took the Premier League title back to west London in 2009/10 as part of a domestic double with the FA Cup. While Mourinho’s return to Stamford Bridge brought the title home again in 2014/15. Antonio Conte would then oversee their latest title in 2016/17.  
  Players and managers  
  Mourinho, Ancelotti, Di Matteo and Tuchel cemented their names in Chelsea’s club history over their triumphant tenures. Their spells at the Stamford Bridge helm also helped to form a vast number of Chelsea legends including Frank Lampard and John Terry to Eden Hazard.  
  Terry spent 19 years in west London and became Chelsea’s most successful captain through his 717 appearances. The centre-back won five Premier League titles, the FA Cup five times and the Champions League once. He also skippered the Blues to one Europa League trophy.  
  Lampard, meanwhile, established himself among the greatest midfielders to ever grace the Premier League whilst at Stamford Bridge. His box-to-box brilliance over 13 years at Chelsea further saw the West Ham United product become the Blues’ record scorer with 211 goals.

  History of the club from Staré Město  
  The football club at Staré Město was founded in 1927 under the nae SK Staré Město. The were 4 football clubs in the 1930s which played in Staré Město; SK, Orel, Rudá hvězda (Red star) and Viktoria. In 1948 the club changed its name to Sokol Staré Město, and 5 years later the name was replaced with Jiskra Staré Město.  
  Until 1978, when the club got promoted to higher division, it has only ever played in regional competitions. In 1993 the club let go of the name Jiskra and replaced it with SFK Staré Město. A year later after an affiliation of civic association and company Synot, who started to have influence of football in Staré Město, the clubs name was changed once more to FC Synot Staré Město.  
  From early 1980s up until the promotion to 2nd tier league, FC Synot Staré Město was playing in the 3rd tier league, whether it was the II. ČNL (Czech National League) or MSFL (Moravian - Silesian Football League). Synot got promoted to 1st tier league in 2000, which allowed the merging of Synot with Slovácká Slavie Uherské Hradiště to happen.  
  History of the club from Uherské Hradiště  
  Football in Uherké Hradiště started to emerge to scene around 1894, however the first football club in the city was founded after the beggening of the new century under the name Český fotbalový klub Uherské Hradiště.  
  After some years the club decided to change its name to AC Slovácká Slavia Uherské Hradiště which lasted until 1948, when the name of the club was replaced with SK Slovácká Slavia Uherské Hradiště and straight after to Sokol Slovácká Slavia Uherké Hradiště. It didn’t take too long until another change of the name happened, this time it was TJ Spartak Hradišťan Uherské Hradiště.  
  The club got promoted to 2nd tier league In 1961, where it managed to stay for 4 years, during which TJ Slovácká Slavia Uherské Hradiště was announced as the new name of the club. Following 28 years from the exception of 1981-1983, the club played in the 3rd tier league. In 1993 TJ Slovácká Slavia gave way to the joint-stock company FC TIC Slovácká Slavia Uherské Hradiště which was therefore established as the new name of the club.  
  During next year the club from Uherské Hradiště secured a promotion to 2nd tier league and a year after a historic promotion to 1st tier league, as Slovácká Slavia won the II. ČNL. The first year was however a disaster as the club finished last and got relegated back to 2nd tier league. Due to financial problems of TIC company, the club decided to conclude the relationship with the company and look for a fresh start with company JOKO in 1995, which lead to another change of name, this time to FC JOKO Slovácká Slavia Uherské Hradiště. However, the financial stability of the club has not improved and had to go to divisional football. This lead to Slovácká Slavia playing without the sponsors name JOKO from 1997, which after lead to the merge with FC Synot Staré Město

  Former Arsenal and Chelsea defender Ashley Cole has been inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame.  
  The former England international, widely regarded as the best left-back in Premier League history, won three titles across a 15-year career in the top-flight.  
  Cole, the 22nd inductee into the Hall of Fame, was part of Arsenal's famous Invincibles that won the title in 2003/04, still the only side in league history to go unbeaten for a whole season.  
  Having come through Arsenal's academy, Cole signed for Chelsea in 2006 and won his third Premier League title in 2009/10 as Carlo Ancelotti's side scored a then-record 103 goals.  
  "I'm honoured to join the Premier League Hall of Fame. It's humbling and fulfilling to be rewarded at the end of your career," said Cole.  
  "I went through my career just trying to give my best and be good enough. You take it day by day and game by game. As a young kid, you never dream of any of this and you just do it for the love of the game of football.  
  "I played for some fantastic clubs with incredible fans. Winning trophies with my boyhood club Arsenal and with Chelsea are amazing memories that will always be with me.  
  Also See:  
  "It's emotional to reflect because a lot of hard work has been put in. To join the Hall of Fame alongside the likes of Alan Shearer, Thierry Henry, Didier Drogba and Rio Ferdinand, I'm privileged to be in their company."  
  Cole finished his Premier League career with a win rate of 62 per cent, keeping 147 clean sheets in 385 appearances. The full-back also scored 15 goals and provided 31 assists.  
  Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said: "If you ask people for the best full-back in Premier League history, many of them would name Ashley Cole. He excelled for title-winning Arsenal and Chelsea sides and helped to redefine the position thanks to his defensive and attacking qualities.  
  "After breaking through as a youngster at Arsenal, he will always be remembered as part of the iconic 'Invincibles' team, whose achievements remain unprecedented to this day.  
  "He continued his winning ways at Chelsea, forming a key part of one of the highest-scoring sides we have ever seen, and we are delighted to welcome him as the latest inductee into the Premier League Hall of Fame."  
  The stats behind Cole's magnificent PL career  
  Ashley Cole made 385 Premier League appearances between 2000 and 2014, winning three Premier League titles - two with Arsenal (2001/02, 2003/04) and one with Chelsea (2009/10).  
  He was directly involved in 46 goals from left-back - only two defenders had more goals and assists combined during the same time period, while only Leighton Baines assisted more goals.  
  Only three defenders registered more than Cole's 147 clean sheets (John Terry, Jamie Carragher and Rio Ferdinand) between his first and last appearances, while it was the most of any full-back in that time.  
  During his time at Chelsea between 2006/07 and 2013/14, Cole ranked in the top-five for chances created, (overall and in open play) tackles and successful passes (overall and in the opposition half) among Premier League defenders.

  A glimmer of hope for Ajax. Tiny Hoekstra makes the goal with an excellent pass through the middle and Chasity Grant shoots at goal from the edge of the penalty area, but Chelsea goalkeeper Zecira Musovic just has to do better. The shot isn't filled with power, but goes through Musovic's hands and crawls over the line.

  Former England captain Houghton to retirepublished at 20:56

  Houghton, 35, is City's record appearance holder and is part of the squad in contention to win the WSL title this season.  
  Houghton has 121 England caps but has not played for her country since 2021.  
  "I hope I leave the game in a better place than when I started," Houghton, who began at Sunderland in 2002, said. "And [I hope] I have contributed in some small way to giving the girls of tomorrow a better future in football."  
  Centre-back Houghton spent five years at Sunderland, followed by three-year spells at Leeds and Arsenal, before joining City in 2014.  
  She made her England debut against Russia in March 2007, going on to appear at two World Cups and two European Championships.  
  Houghton also represented Team GB at London 2012 and Rio 2016.  
  "Taking the decision to retire, is such a difficult thing to do," said Houghton, who was awarded an MBE in 2016 for her achievements in women's football.  
  "Whilst age comes to every player, it makes it no easier having to say the words out loud. Football has been my life; my passion and I have loved the career I have had."

  FC Zbrojovka Brno is a professional football club based in the city of Brno, South Moravia, Czech Republic and named after Zbrojovka Brno, a firearms manufacturer. Founded in 1913 as SK Židenice, the club later became known as Zbrojovka Brno. Brno won the Czechoslovak First League in the 1977–78 season and finished as runners-up in 1979–80.  
  This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (January 2013)  
  The club, initially known as SK Židenice, played in the top tier of Czechoslovak football from 1933 until suffering relegation in the 1946–47 Czechoslovak First League.[1] During this period, the club entered the Mitropa Cup three times, reaching the quarter-finals in 1935 as well as taking part in the competition in 1936 and 1938.  
  Between 1950 and 1962 the club played outside the top tier, returning in the 1962–63 Czechoslovak First League.[1] Five seasons elapsed before the club was again relegated, in 1967.[1] They then spent four years in the second tier of Czechoslovak football before returning to the top flight.[1] In the 1970s the club was a strong force in the country, winning the Czechoslovak First League in 1978, finishing third the following season and being runners up in 1980.  
  The 1980s were less spectacular for Brno, as the club was relegated in 1983, playing until 1989 in the second tier. After just two seasons in the top tier, the club finished last in 1991 and was again relegated.[1]  
  Between 1992 and 2011, Brno played in the top tier of the Czech Republic for 19 consecutive seasons, the longest such spell in the club's history.[1] In 2011, the club was relegated to the second division.[1] In the 2011–12 Czech 2. Liga, the club only managed to finish fourth, missing out on the promotion places. However, due to the stadium requirements of the Czech First League, champions FK Ústí nad Labem as well as third-placed FK Baník Sokolov were ineligible for promotion. As a result, Brno won promotion immediately back to the top tier.[2] In 2018, the club was relegated to the second division.[3] In the 2018–19 Czech Second League, the club managed to finish third but lost the promotion play-off to Příbram.[4]

  In 1962, there was an amalgamation between Rudá Hvězda Brno (1956–62) and Spartak ZJŠ Brno.  
  Brno have competed a number of times in European competitions, reaching the second round of the 1978–79 European Cup in their only appearance to date in the competition. The club played in the 1993–94 European Cup Winners' Cup but lost in the first round.  
  Brno took part in the UEFA Cup three times, reaching the quarter-finals in 1979–80 and also playing in 1980–81 and 1997–98.  
  Because Brno was a major fairs city of Czechoslovakia, teams from Brno played in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in the 1960s. It was Spartak KPS Brno who participated first, then Spartak ZJŠ Brno (Zbrojovka) played five times in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in a row, reaching the quarter-finals in 1963–64.  
  Brno (then SK Židenice) competed in the Mitropa Cup three times before World War II, reaching the quarter-finals in 1935.  
  Brno have played at Městský fotbalový stadion Srbská since 2001, when they moved from previous home Stadion Za Lužánkami.[6] In the 1990s, Brno attracted record crowds to their football matches, with Za Lužánkami as the venue for all of the top ten most-attended Czech First League matches.[7] The highest attendance for a Brno match is 44,120, set in a league match against Slavia Prague.[7]

  Brazilian striker, Gabriel Barbosa, who was strongly linked with a move to Chelsea in 2020, has been banned from football for two years following a doping fraud investigation. He plans to appeal this decision.  
  At the time he left to join Inter from Santos before moving to Benfica on loan briefly. He rejoined Santos and then eventually swapped Italy for South America again when signed by Flamengo.  
  Boasting an impressive record as a youngster - 65 goals in 164 games and being described as the 'new Neymar' - he remained one of the most popular wonderkids in the world. After a stuttering period in Europe, Chelsea were tipped to bring him in for reinforcements following their 2019 transfer ban. Gabigol was also pursued by West Ham.  
  Lampard was reportedly keen to add him to a young Chelsea squad as competition for Tammy Abraham. Now 27, he has previously expressed his desire to play in England. "I like the Premier League very much," he said. "It combines technique, strength and speed. I always follow the games from Brazil.  
  "It really is a place I would like to play. It’s one of the best leagues in the world. Every player dreams of being a champion and winning the Premier League must be indescribable."  
  Last year, there were reports that Manchester United were keen on signing the Brazilian forward in a possible swap deal with Antony. However, these claims were dismissed by Flamengo's vice president, who said there was "zero chance" of such a deal happening.  
  Now, he will have his appeal to a ban heard by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), according to Brazilian news outlet Globo. It's reported that Barbosa drew attention to himself with unusual behaviour during a test on April 8, 2023.  
  Anti-doping officers who came to test players at the club training ground were largely ignored by Barbosa, who took his test hours after his teammates, reports the Manchester Evening News. Barbosa's lawyers have argued that his blood test at the time showed he was clean.  
  They also stated that his unfriendly behaviour towards the officers did not mean he cheated the test. Flamengo have also stood by their player. In a statement, they said: "There was no fraud, not even an attempted fraud."  
  "The club received the decision with surprise and will help the athlete in his representation at the Court for Arbitration of Sport," the statement added. Barbosa wrote on Instagram: "Since the beginning of my career as a football player, I have always followed the rules of the game and never used prohibited substances.  
  "I have already been subjected to dozens of tests, all of which were always negative, which reinforces my commitment to my club and to the Brazilian fans. I am disappointed with the outcome of the trial, but I will continue to cooperate with the sports authorities and I am confident that my innocence will be proven and re-established by the higher court convinced that my integrity and innocence will be upheld by a higher authority."

  Fran Kirby joins exclusive 200-appearance club in modern era of Chelsea FC Women  
  Share this story  
  Share All sharing options for: Fran Kirby joins exclusive 200-appearance club in modern era of Chelsea FC Women  
  While there have been nearly 100 players (98, to be exact) who have made over 200 appearances for the Chelsea men’s team, on the women’s side, that club is a lot smaller and a lot more exclusive.  
  After all, the “modern era” of Chelsea FC Women is only about 20 years old, since Chelsea “Ladies” became a financed part of the Chelsea organization in 2004 — and, in general, there are fewer matches to be played in a season as well (though that’s slowly increasing). So reaching 200 appearances takes a lot longer than it does on the men’s side. For example, Claire Rafferty played for us for over a decade, from 2007 to 2018, but barely cracked 100 (thanks in part to several major injuries as well).  
  Statistics are also a lot harder to come by, but as far as I can tell, when she came on as a substitute in yesterday’s 2-0 win over West Ham United, Fran Kirby became only the sixth Women’s player in our history to reach the 200-appearance mark.  
  Extremely proud to have made my 200th appearance. Thank you to the girls for their support pic.twitter.com/amawY1Md2Y  
  She joins Drew Spence (who was the first, in 2020), Millie Bright (in 2022), Ji So-yun (also in 2022), Erin Cuthbert (who may be the fastest to have gotten there, at the start of this season), and Sophie Ingle (in December). Kirby, who’s the all-time leading goalscorer for the Women’s team, probably would’ve gotten here a lot faster were it not for a few health scares and injuries in recent years, but those challenges only add to the impressiveness of this feat.  
  Congrats, Super Fran! Here’s to many more still to come!

  Mauricio Pochettino enters another crucial week as Chelsea manager with plenty on the line. The Blues are already struggling in mid-table and could end the weekend as low as 14th if things go against them whilst more importantly the gap to the top four continues to grow.  
  Brighton, who they face on Sunday, are already six points ahead with West Ham in ninth four clear as well. With Manchester United to follow in mid-week this is shaping up to be a defining early period for the boss.  
  The Spanish left-back has been filling in for Ben Chilwell and Levi Colwill on the left as well as James and Malo Gusto at right-back too on occasion. He picked up a fifth yellow card of the season despite being a rotation option and is banned for the game.  
  Gusto himself is likely to be out with injury. "Not too many news," Pochettino said on Friday when asked about his squad. "We don't believe that we can recover some players as quickly as possible. But there is still one training [session] more tomorrow, so if we can see if some players are available more."  
  Gusto will be one of those fighting for his place but the 20-year-old was added to the list of injuries released on Friday and is a serious doubt. Given the lack of senior options available, Trevoh Chalobah and Wesley Fofana are still injured, it leaves the academy with a chance to fill the bench.  
  In midfield and it is likely to be the same old story, though Moises Caicedo may well get himself a start after not being deemed fit to go from the off last week. Romeo Lavia is a doubt and isn't expected to make the squad, Christopher Nkunku, however, could be in line.  
  "We need to assess tomorrow and then decide," Pochettino said of the pair.. "They are close, but we need tomorrow to take the decision." He went on to add: "Maybe Lavia is the more difficult [one] to play. But we need to assess Nkunku."  
  With Nkunku in there is a question over the balance of the 20-man squad. If he returns then someone has to miss out and the midfield options could be left light. Carney Chukwuemeka is still injured and even with Lesley Ugochukwu from the bench it could be lopsided.  
  In attack there would be four players, at least one for each slot and then a roaming Nkunku figure that can play anywhere. The rest of the squad is searching for depth though with Alex Matos the next most likely player to feature. Deivid Washington is now firmly with the Under-21s it seems.  
  Pochettino has been prone to naming two goalkeepers on the bench this season as well but if Nkunku is back then that is all but out the window too. Here, football.london looks at how the squad could take shape.

  Just when you thought you were out, the German national team is pulling you back in.  
  With a resurgent Bayern Munich trying to make one last run at glory on the club scene, the German national team has risen from the ashes to show that it just might be a contender for the EUROs this summer.  
  After dispatching France on Saturday, the Germans outlasted the Dutch 2-1 in a thoroughly impressive victory.  
  Let’s not waste any more time, here are some quick hitters on the match:  
  As always, let’s start with Julian Nagelsmann’s starting XI:  
  As expected, Nagelsmann kept things exactly the same. It seems as if the coach has found an XI he likes and wants to build off of it.  
  Joey Veerman put the Netherlands up 1-0 in the 4th minute with a perfectly placed volley just outside the reach of Marc-André ter Stegen for a quick goal. Memphis Depay sent the ball in and took advantage of some lax defending from the Germans.  
  Germany appeared stunned for a few minutes. Like a boxer, who had taken a massive shot, Germany somehow climbed up off of the canvas and got back to work. It took a bit, but the Germans woke up in a big way.  
  Maximilian Mittelstädt rifled a shot into the net for a goal to tie the game. What a moment it was for the VfB Stuttgart man.  
  There was a genuine energy and life in the match for Germany after that. The Dutch were game as well, which made the contest a fantastic one to watch.  
  Ter Stegen was a bit shaky. In the 19th minute, he nearly gifted Netherlands another good chance by tipping a ball out into danger that he should have probably handled cleanly.  
  Germany was playing with a purpose and with some fight and pride. It was refreshing to watch.  
  Jamal Musiala had some slipping issues. Someone needs to check those cleats! Really, though, the whole surface seemed slick for everyone and Bavarian Grass Works should investigate.  
  The Dutch were super-aggressive with their style of play. It was almost as if they were banking on Germany eventually cracking under the pressure…but it never happened.  
  I don’t know how Germany can remove Florian Wirtz or Jamal Musiala from the lineup. If Nagelsmann truly is intent on starting Leroy Sané, he is going to have to send his captain, İlkay Gündoğan, to the bench or go striker-less.  
  Germany looked organized and fierce...it was really impressive.  
  If there is a fair critique of Germany’s play, it is that there tends to be a gap behind the midfield and in front of the backline that seems to be ripe for a team to eventually expose.  
  Germany’s press was effective and disruptive.  
  Matthijs de Ligt sent a header across the face of the goal that probably should have resulted in a score for the Dutch. Donyell Malen could not do enough to get out on the end of it before it was cleared.  
  The Netherlands was a little more authoritative and controlling to start the second half, but Germany rallied.  
  Mittelstädt has added some fight and physicality to his game, which is a welcome sight. He definitely won some fans and will likely have some Bayern Munich supporters calling on him as a replacement for Alphonso Davies, should the Canadian leave this summer.  
  Depay should have given the Dutch the lead in the 61st minute.  
  In the 68th minute, Chris Führich sent in a beautiful cross, but Kai Havertz could not get on the end of it. Führich was excellent and total difference maker for Germany.  
  After some great passing, Musiala was on the end of a chance that should have been a goal. The youngster just could not place his shot where he likely wanted to. That would have been massive in the 77th minute.  
  Musiala did looked cooked at that point in the game, though. Nagelsmann might have done well to take him out. Later, he would slip again in a very advantageous position, which would have resulted in a good chance. Aside of the slick field and his cleats not being able to get a grip, Musiala’s legs were probably weary.  
  Thomas Müller almost won the game for Germany in the 83rd minute, but Bart Verbruggen made a fantastic save.  
  In the 86th minute — after sustained pressure — Germany broke through to take the lead. A corner from Toni Kroos hit Niclas Füllkrug in the shoulder and it somehow got over the line enough to count for a score. What a crazy sequence after a dominant run of play for Germany.  
  Wout Weghorst should have tied the game in extra time, but he mishit his attempt.  
  Overall, what a two-game set from Germany. Julian Nagelsmann is proving his doubters wrong (I know I did not think he could be effective in this format) and he is drawing the best from the German squad. The energy, intensity, ferocity, and teamwork was just incredible to witness after the team was in the doldrums for so long. You really could not ask for much more at this point from the team or its coach.  
  Chelsea FC let Jamal Musiala walk off campus once before, but it seems like the London club realized its mistake.  
  Now, Chelsea wants to bring its former charge back into the fold:  
  Chelsea continue to track the contract talks of Bayern Munich midfielder Jamal Musiala along with fellow Premier League giants Liverpool.  
  At 21 years old, Musiala is already one of the most talented midfielders in the game, but with a contract that expires in 2026, a window of opportunity is potentially opening for him to be taken away from the Bundesliga side.  
  Bayern, as well as Chelsea and Liverpool, are acutely aware of this and working to tie him down to a new contract.  
  If Chelsea is serious about Musiala, it could appeal to the player to return “home” and lead the club back to some sort of glory. Could something like that convince the youngster to make the move back to London?  
  Harry Kane captains the English national team, but is not exactly targeting the armband at Bayern Munich to add to his collection.  
  That is not to say that Kane would shy away from the duty, but he says those decision happen organically.  
  “It just happens. We have a few leaders in the team — it depends on the coach and the club. If there’s a game where our captains are unavailable, I would be proud to wear the armband for this club. But I’m not thinking about that at the moment. I’m always the same player, regardless of whether I’m captain or not. I train, speak and play the same way. And that won’t change,” Kane said.  
  An interesting point brought by our own RLD is that Bayern Munich actually has been tied to three captains for the Three Lions — Kane, Kyle Walker, and Declan Rice. That appears to be the captain pecking order for England, which came to light with the injuries to Kane and Walker.  
  Bayern Munich will be back in action later this on the field, but there is much going on in the boardroom these days.  
  While all of that is going on, the German national team is looking like they could potentially have something cooking. Therefore, we have much to talk about.  
  This is what we have on tap for this episode:  
  After some times to process it all, more thoughts on Germany’s 2-0 win over France and why it seems like Julian Nagelsmann could be close to unlocking something with this German side.  
  Reports are breaking that Bayern Munich wants an answer from Alphonso Davies by next week. Will the Canadian take the best-and-final offer from the Bavarians or will he set sights on a move this summer...maybe to Real Madrid?  
  One year after Nagelsmann was unceremoniously sacked at Bayern Munich, the fallout is still being felt. Let’s discuss where things stand and how much longer that move might affect the club.  
  Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain could be competing for Napoli striker Victor Osimhen:  
  Chelsea are still leading the race to sign Napoli striker Victor Osimhen, whose price tag has been set at £111m. Paris Saint-Germain are also keen on the 25-year-old.  
  Bayern Munich president Herbert Hainer says that the club is going to take its time during its coaching search.  
  “Now we have some time to look around, and that’s what we’re going to do. We have now changed three coaches within a not too long period of time. We want to work with a coach in the long term. We will think about and analyze this very carefully — and hopefully get the right one. We want to find a coach in calm, and when we have found him, we will announce it,” Hainer said.  
  Even during the international break, the Bavarians are feeling the wrath of the injury gods. Even aside of that, though, Max Eberl seems to have ramped up his planning for the 2024/25 campaign, so there is a lot going on.  
  Why waste any more time, let’s get to it. Here is what we have on tap for this episode:  
  Bodies are dropping at Germany’s national team camp — and at Bayern Munich. Let’s talk about the impact of Manuel Neuer’s latest ailment, Sacha Boey’s injury, and what this might mean for the rest of the club season.  
  Could Bayern Munich bring Julian Nagelsmann back as its coach?  
  Some final thoughts on the German national team’s upcoming slate.  
  Bayern Munich reportedly made its best-and-final offer to Alphonso Davies, which tops out at €13 million per season. Is that enough? Will Real Madrid top that?  
  Enough with these Ronald Araújo rumors.  
  Why are Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka so hated? How real is it that both will leave this summer?  
  Breaking down another hilarious episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm.  
  Bayern Munich executive Max Eberl knows that the club can’t always spend big — and he does not want to get into that habit. However, the “new guy” will also not shy away from such a move if it is right for the moment.  
  “Bayern Munich can’t do that all the time. Now Harry Kane has proven his worth for Bayern, but we can’t make such transfers all the time and maybe we don’t even want to. We want to build a team, development and success, that’s really what we need to achieve here. And yet, there are very, very good players who maybe don’t cost 100 million, who don’t cost 80 million. We have to find this mix,” Eberl said. “We simply have to build a good team with our financial means, which I then look at and which Mr. Dreesen and Mr. Diederich then give me. Mathys Tel, Aleksandar Pavlović, great, the way he plays the games, with self-confidence at the age of 19, Jamal Musiala – we have these players and we would like to have more of them.”  
  Real Madrid has liked what it has seen from Toni Kroos this season and wants the 34-year-old to ink a new deal:  
  Real Madrid are reportedly hoping to keep Toni Kroos at the club for another season. Despite his age and the rise of Real’s young midfielders such as Jude Bellingham, Eduardo Camavinga and Aurelien Tchouameni, Kroos has still made 38 appearances this season, although his contract expires at the end of the campaign.  
  And, according to Fabrizio Romano, Real would like to extend that deal, with Carlo Ancelotti’s side confident about their prospects of doing so.  
  The German national team had not really fired on all cylinders for, well, years.  
  With deflating performance after deflating performance, there was very little reason for hope...until now!  
  While it is just one match, the Germans were able to outgun France 2-0 for a convincing away win. Clearly, there was a lot to talk about and with Jack Laushway making his Bavarian Podcast Works debut to help break this one down, we went all-in!  
  This is what we have on tap for this episode:  
  A look at Julian Nagelsmann’s starting XI and how those players performed.  
  A rundown of the scoring and subs.  
  Some thoughts on Germany’s blazing start to the match and that laser of a goal from Florian Wirtz.  
  Kai Havertz proved he up to the task after an iffy first half (with some major help from Bayern Munich’s Jamal Musiala).  
  Joshua Kimmich vs. Kylian Mbappé.  
  Who was impactful and who might not have turned in their best effort.  
  Some final thoughts on the impressive victory (is this a cause for hope?) and why this was incredibly important to Nagelsmann and the players alike.  
  Leroy Sané seems pretty set on a contract extension with Bayern Munich, but there is some thought that Manchester City could be seeking to bring back its old charge:  
  Bayern Munich and Germany star Leroy Sane has been linked with a potential return to Manchester City this summer, four years after quitting the club for the Bundesliga.  
  The 28-year-old left Manchester City for Bayern Munich in a £54.8 million move in July 2020, leaving the Etihad Stadium after four years, having initially moved to the Premier League for £37 million from Schalke.  
  Bayern Munich and Germany star Leroy Sane has been linked with a potential return to Manchester City this summer, four years after quitting the club for the Bundesliga.  
  The 28-year-old left Manchester City for Bayern Munich in a £54.8 million move in July 2020, leaving the Etihad Stadium after four years, having initially moved to the Premier League for £37 million from Schalke.  
  The forward made 135 appearances and won seven trophies with the Sky Blues, but featured just twice during his final campaign at Manchester City after suffering an ACL injury against Liverpool in the FA Community Shield.  
  According to the information of Manchester City insider ‘Tolmie’s Hairdoo’ on X, the 28-year-old is interested in a potential return to the Etihad Stadium this summer, with the forward wanting to ‘come home’ after four years in Germany.  
  The forward is the third Bayern Munich star to be linked with a move to east Manchester ahead of the new season, with both Joshua Kimmich and Jamal Musiala widely reported as possible targets.  
  Hold on...what? Here is the original tweet:  
  Lots of potential business between City and @FCBayernEN this summer. Kimmich, Musiala, Cancelo. But one to keep an interesting eye on...Leroy Sane wants to come "home". Would you? Would Pep?  
  — The Real Tolmie's Hairdoo (@RealTolmie) March 24, 2024  
  Well...maybe the most recent reports from Germany linking the winger to a contract extension in Germany are a little more concrete?  
  Anyway, it is food for thought if the negotiations go south for whatever reason between Sané and Bayern.  
  Bayern Munich has been linked to Ronald Araújo for months, but it seems like FC Barcelona would like to extend his deal:  
  It is no secret that Barcelona want to assure Ronald Araujo’s continuity beyond his ongoing contract. The 25-year-old Uruguayan, who is a subject of interest for Bayern Munich, has a contract with Barcelona until 2026 and the team from from Catalonia wants to resolve the entire matter before the end of the season.  
  Leading up to the story, a report from Mundo Deportivo has affirmed that there is a growing sense of optimism within the team that Araujo will extend his contract sooner rather than later. Araujo stands as a pillar of Barcelona, and the club is keen on maintaining this status for the foreseeable future. Disregarding Bayern Munich’s €90 million offer, which was turned down earlier this year, the Uruguayan is viewed as a vital asset to Barcelona’s sporting ambitions.  
  Consequently, negotiations to extend his current contract beyond 2026 rank high on the agenda of the club’s top brass.

  Historical Crests: Chelsea FC  
  Chelsea FC  
  The Blues  
  Chelsea Football club is based in Fulham, London. Chelsea is one England’s most successful clubs. They won their first League Championship in 1955. They won the FA Cup for the first time in 1970 and their first European Cup, the UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup in 1971. After a period of decline, the club had a revival in the 1990s. The past two decades have been the most successful in Chelsea’s history. Since 2003 the club has been owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich. He invested hundreds of millions of pounds and by hiring some of the best players in the world Chelsea won the league title in 2005 (fifty years after their first). Next to this they won the Champions League trophy in 2012 and they are still the only London club to have won the Champions League. The club have rivalries with neighbouring teams Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur and a historic rivalry with Leeds United. The first crest was introduced with the club’s establishment in 1905, featuring a famous Chelsea Pensioner which gave rise to their early nickname. The 1953-54 season saw a new crest inspired by the civic coat of arms of the London borough the club resided in. Notable for the heraldic lion, this crest is the one most readily identified with Chelsea and became the first to adorn a club shirt in 1960. A new crest based around the club’s initials and a more realistic lion was established in 1986. Today the club’s crest features a ceremonial lion rampant holding a staff.

  History  
  In 1855, members of a Sheffield cricket club organised informal kick-abouts without any official rules.  
  Subsequently, two members, Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, formed the Sheffield Football Club.  
  The inaugural meeting of the club took place on 24 October 1857 at Parkfield House in the suburb of Highfield in Sheffield. The original headquarters was a greenhouse on East Bank Road lent to them by Thomas Asline Ward, father of the first club president Frederick Ward, and the adjacent field was used as their first playing ground. Initially, Sheffield FC games were played among club members themselves and took the format of “Married v Singles” or “Professionals v the Rest”.  
  Creswick and Prest were responsible for drawing up the club’s rules of play, which were decided upon at the club’s AGM on 21 October 1858, and published the following year. They were referred to as the Sheffield Rules, and were the first detailed set of rules of football to be published by a football club (as opposed to a school or university). At the time, before the formation of the Football Association (FA), many different kinds of football were popular in England. For example, each of the various public schools played football according to their own individual rules, and these varied widely. The Sheffield Rules were later adopted by the Sheffield Football Association when it was formed in 1867  
  Sheffield’s near neighbour, Hallam FC was formed in 1860 and in the same year the two clubs first met each other in a Local Derby which is still contested today.  
  They became members of The Football Association on 30 November 1863 but continued to use their own set of rules. On 2 January 1865, the club played its first fixture outside Sheffield against Nottingham playing eighteen-a-side under Nottingham Rules.  
  By this time the club had decided only to play teams outside Sheffield in order to seek a bigger challenge. On 31 March 1866, Sheffield played a ‘London’ team under FA Rules at Battersea Park. The game, played as an eleven aside, was won by London by 2 goals and four touches down to nil. However, the matter of Rules being disputed around the country was solved by the adaptation by Sheffield FC of the FA rules in 1878.  
  1857The First Team of The World  
  Sheffield Football Club is founded on October 24th, by the pioneers, Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, who wanted to build a community for the game of football. A game for young and old people alike to play in their free-time. The club’s committee decides to develop a new set of rules and laws for the game of football.  
  1859‘Mob Football’  
  Starting with the foundation of the club in 1857, the club’s committee studies the various rules and codes of ‘Mob Football’ which was often played at universities. After two years of experiments and debate they lay down their own set of standardised laws, which become the foundation of today’s modern game. Written by Nathaniel Creswick (left) and William Prest (right), the Rulebook of 1859 is the first official set of rules and laws for the game of football and defined the inventions of a corner kick, throw-in, free-kick, cross-bar and fouls.  
  1860First Inter-Club Game  
  On Boxing Day in 1860, Sheffield FC plays the first inter-club game against Hallam FC at Sandygate Lane, thereby becoming the first and oldest local derby in global football. Sheffield FC won this match 2-0. This legacy has lived on ever since, with both clubs competing against each other in a friendly match at amateur level every year.  
  1863English Football Association  
  Sheffield Club members are instrumental in the formation of the English Football Association.  
  1865Sheffield FC v Nottingham  
  First out of town match when Sheffield travel to play Nottinghamshire at the Meadows Cricket Ground. The Club won the match with the only goal of the game.  
  1866First Inter-City Match  
  The Club plays its first inter-city match with London City at Battersea Park. The sight of the Sheffield players ‘butting’ the ball with their heads reduces the London players and fans to fits of laughter. Heading is born. (picture: map of Battersea Park).  
  1866London v Sheffield FC  
  Sheffield travel to play their first game under the London FA Laws, losing 2-0 at Battersea Park under the unfamiliar rules, which included touchdowns. The Sheffield Rules had seen the invention of heading in the game and the sight of the Sheffield players 'butting' the ball with their heads reduces the London players and fans to fits of laughter.  
  1867The World's First Football Tournament  
  The world’s first football tournament, the ‘Youdan Cup’ was played under Sheffield Rules in 1867.  
  Sheffield FC's Club Secretary William Chesterman travels to London with a letter of support for the FA to continue their work as they propose dissolving the organisation at their 1867 annual meeting.  
  1872First International Match  
  Sir Charles Clegg, also known as the ‘Napoleon of Football’, a regular feature on the Sheffield FC team sheet and one of the club’s greatest pioneers, plays in the first international match between England and Scotland. In 1890 Sheffield’s famous son becomes chairman of the FA.  
  1873Sheffield play in the FA Cup for the first time  
  Over the next 5 years they would reach the Quarter Final stage 3 times as their support saw the competition triple in size and grow from a London cup to become a national competition.  
  1878First Match played under Floodlights  
  On October 14th, Sheffield’s Bramall Lane ground hosts a match between two sides pulled from local players. It was the first match in football history to be played under floodlights. The experiment in night-time football was a great success, with approximately 20,000 people attending the legendary match at Bramall Lane, now the home of Sheffield United FC.  
  1885Introduction of Professionalism  
  Its decline from the top echelon of football began with the introduction of professionalism in July 1885, with the amateurs of Sheffield failing to compete with professional teams; losing heavily that year to Aston Villa, Nottingham Forest and Notts County. After the legalisation of professionalism, Sheffield FC suggests to the FA the creation of a cup exclusively for amateur clubs – namely the ‘FA Amateur Cup’.  
  Sadly, in this year, on February 10th, William Prest dies, at the age of 52, from a fatal seizure due to a ruptured blood vessel.  
  1904Sheffield's Historic Victory  
  Sheffield FC celebrates their finest hour by lifting the Amateur Cup. The team won the final against Ealing, 3-1, with a crowd of 6,000 supporters seeing Sheffield’s historic victory.  
  1905First Football World Tour  
  ‘The Pilgrims’, an amateur representative team, tour the U.S. and Canada. Frederick Houghton Milnes, a talented and well-known Sheffield amateur player, was involved in that first tour. Milnes was part of the Sheffield FC team that won the FA Amateur Cup in 1904 and was subsequently the moving spirit behind ‘The Pilgrims’.  
  It was reported that ‘The Pilgrims’ were specially selected by US President Theodore Roosevelt, who was conducting a campaign to eliminate brutality from American college football by increasing the popularity of soccer. ‘The Pilgrims’ tour of 1905 represents the first serious attempt to popularise association football in that country.  
  1917Nathaniel Creswick dies  
  At the age of 86, Nathaniel Creswick dies, in the month of October, exactly 60 years after his gift to football, the legacy of 1857.  
  1946FC Eindhoven vs Sheffield FC  
  In June 1946 Sheffield FC travels into Europe to play a friendly against FC Eindhoven. Sheffield won 3-0 against Eindhoven and a trophy from the encounter is still in the hands of the oldest club.  
  Since their first trip to the Netherlands in 1894, Sheffield FC has played a few games against Eindhoven. The games between the two cities were arranged through the Sheffield-Eindhoven branch of the Anglo-Dutch Sports Association – formed to develop relations between the two countries through sport – and the Sheffield and Hallamshire County FA.  
  1949Yorkshire League  
  The World’s First Football Club joins the ‘Yorkshire League’ in 1949, remaining in that competition until it merged with the ‘Midland League’ to form the ‘Northern Counties East League’ in 1982. During their 33-year stay in the ‘Yorkshire League’, their only divisional title was the Division Two crown in 1975–76.

  2019The Story of 1857, Football Pioneers  
  In memory of football’s pioneers, Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, who founded the World’s First Football Club on October 24th, 1857: Sheffield FC.  
  History  
  Here we look at the final years and the new history since 2003.  
  After many successful years as a senior football club, Clydebank FC went into decline at the end of the 1995-96 season. The Steedman family who owned the club decided to sell New Kilbowie Park without a credible plan for relocating the club to a new home within the town boundaries.  
  The club were to play at the home of county neighbours Dumbarton for the next two seasons. During this period the club was sold to ex-pat business man John Hall who promised the fans a brighter future and immediately started to recruit a better standard of player. However, Hall and his associates had an ulterior motive with a planned relocation to Dublin being the main aim. When this news was revealed this sparked a series of protests by the supporters, and the plan was ultimately doomed by FIFA who would not allow a club to play cross borders. Attempts to sell/merge the club to Gala Fairydean/Livingston/Carlisle United also failed and Hall’s waning interest saw the club fall into administration.  
  The club were to play their final years at Greenock Morton’s Cappielow which was an impossible journey for most supporters. A repreive seemed possible though, when Businessman David McGhie looked to take the club out of administration. An associate of football agent John Viola, a procession of under performing ex-Scotland internationals, and players past their best were brought to the club as the Bankies were a pale shadow of the club who played at Kilbowie Park only a few short years before. This possibility was short-lived as the club continued to be on the brink.  
  At the same time, the heavily indebted Airdrieonians were liquidated. Attempts to relaunch the club were thwarted and the final straw came when Gretna FC were granted membership to the Scottish Football League ahead of the newly formed Airdrie United. Seeing the plight of the Bankies the new owners of Airdrie United made their move to buy Clydebank FC. Despite the Clydebank supporters making a bid to satisfy the administrators requirements, the Airdrie United bid was higher and ultimately accepted. This meant that Clydebank FC were effectively renamed and moved to Airdrie. Airdrie would continue as they were, but only debt free and Clydebank supporters were left with nothing, and the Bankies played their last game against Berwick Rangers at the end of the 2001-02 season.  
  The United Clydebank Supporters refused to allow the club to die. Airdrie United agreed to sign over the club name and crest – the only thing of value to the supporters. An application to join the Scottish Junior Football League was submitted and after one year out of the game the Bankies were back for the start of the 2003-04 season. Playing out of former Duntocher Hibs ground, Glenhead Park the supporters readied the ground for the season ahead. Bankies legend Budgie McGhie was appointed manager and a new chapter for the club began  
  2003-04 The first match back in the town was an emotional one for the supporters who had dealt with the turmoil of the years since moving out of Kilbowie Park. A huge crowd saw the Bankies win 3-2 over St Rochs, and suddenly the past was the past, and the future was now bright. The Bankies were plying their trade in the Central League Division two which is the fourth tier in Junior football. It took the club a while to find their feet, but after a loss to Carluke Rovers in November 2003, the Bankies won 17 of their last 18 games – drawing the other, to lift the title with a game to spare. A crowd of 972 saw the Bankies win their first piece of silverware in the new era with a 5-0 thumping of Coltness United. The Bankies were back, and with a bang.  
  2004-05 The “awkward second album” season followed for the club. No real progress was made in cup competitions, and it was left to the league campaign for any chance of success. Although now playing at a higher level the Bankies seemed to start where they had left off the previous season by winning five of the first six league matches. Unfortunately, this form was not maintained in the second half of the season. Going into the last game of the season promotion was still a possibility but a Clydebank win and favourable results elsewhere were needed. Whilst the Bankies done their bit by beating Benburb 4-0, promotion was denied due to an injury time goal for Dunipace against Yoker Athletic. A case can be made that tangible progress was made with a third placed league finish, but this was arguably the clubs most disappointing season as the many opportunities to gain promotion were not taken.  
  2005-06 The second season in the Central League Division One was a real damp squib for supporters, with the club never really getting into a challenging position. A rally in the spring briefly raised hopes but defeat by East Kilbride ended promotion chances and the Bankies failed to win any of their last five matches. Two defeats from local rivals Yoker summed up the league performances. Where the club did shine however was in the Scottish Junior Cup, the most prestigious competition for non-league clubs. A fantastic run of results saw the Bankies reach the quarter final stage and a draw against Tayport who were among the elite of Junior clubs at the time. A huge support travelled through to Fife and the Bankies returned with a fabulous 1-1 draw and a replay at Glenhead Park. A tremendous crowd of 1142 squeezed in to the “Hibby” and again the sides could not be separated. Unfortunately, the penalty shoot out didn’t go the Bankies way, but they could be proud of their cup exploits.  
  2006-07 The pressure was on for Clydebank to finally gain promotion into the Super Leagues, as supporters and outsiders alike were expecting nothing less. As it turned out it was a two horse race for most of the season with the Bankies and Kirkintilloch Rob Roy switching the top two places on a regular basis. The early part of the season went well with the club qualifying from their Sectional League Cup group for the first time. This form continued as the Bankies reached the final of the tournament. Another large turn out of Clydebank supporters saw the club lose narrowly by 2 goals to 1 against a Pollok side who were sweeping all before them in the Super Premier Division. A first final and a very credible performance. The league title went to Rob Roy who proved to be too strong over the piece but Clydebank secured second place and promotion to the Super League Division One, despite a late rally from Cumbernauld United.  
  2007-08 The new found Super League Status sat well with the club initially as results looked like a league challenge could be made. Qualification from the Sectional League Cup was secured again, but this time the club exited at the quarter final stage against Arthurlie. Notable scalps in the fom of Lochee United and Irvine Meadow were taken in cup competitions, and it was in the Scottish Cup that the Bankies excelled as they reached the Quarter Final for the second time in three years. Top East Region side Bathgate Thistle were the opponents and as per two years ago a 1-1 draw was secured away from home. Unfortunately, Bathgate were a canny side and they triumphed by a goal to nil at Glenhead Park. With deep disappointment a mountain of league fixtures awaited, and the Bankies tumbled to a run of 9 mathches without a win and the very real prospect of relegation. A timely rally saw the Bankies win four games on the spin and a slightly disappointing overall finish of 8th.  
  2008-09 This turned out to be one of the most memorable seasons in the entire history of the club. The club had moved out of Glenhead Park in to a ground sharing arrangement with Yoker Athletic. The league challenge looked real for a long time but eventually faded under a mountain of late spring fixtures. The pile-up was caused by the Clubs outstanding run to the final of the Scottish Junior Cup. The Bankies did carry a little bit of luck along the way, most notably against Carnoustie Panmure who outplayed Clydebank twice but still lost out. However, no one can deny the Bankies stunning win at Premier League Petershill in the Quarter final and the even better result in beating Pollok over two legs in the semi-final including a 3-2 victory at Newlandsfield. It couldn’t have been any harder in the final as the Bankies faced Auchinleck Talbot at Rugby Park. A crowd of 8122 saw the Bankies fight valiantly, but a late goal saw the club lose by the odd goal in three. The league form held up surprisingly well after this loss, but the club ended up well off the pace in fifth position.  
  2009-10 Clydebank were among the favourites for promotion yet again, and despite some up and down form were never out of contention. It was the Scottish Cup that was the distraction yet again as the Bankies made the Semi-final this time, and gaining some revenge over Auchinleck Talbot on the way knocking them out in the fifth round. Clydebank never really looked like reaching the final for the second time as Largs Thistle put in two very professional performances as they won both legs 1-0. The Bankies did gain their first piece of cup silverware by taking the Central League Cup with a 2-0 win over Ashfield at Newlandsfield. The Bankies played 21 matches in 45 days during this period, and the season extended even further when a third placed league finish saw the club earn a play off spot. Clydebank were strong favourites to win the two legged tie against Lanark United, but a first half red card and a penalty miss compounded a miserable night as the Bankies lost 2-0. Clydebank pounded the Lanark goal in the second leg, but could only secure a 2-1 victory and a fourth season in the first division.  
  2010-11 For once Clydebank suffered early defeats in all of the cup competitions meaning the focus could finally be on the goal of being promoted to the Super Premier League. Ten wins in twelve games looked to not only guarantee the club promotion, but possibly the league title into the bargain. However, things are never that straight forward for Clydebank fans. Ashfield had a similarly impressive run of results and it all pointed to a one match shoot out as both sides clashed at Holm Park to decide the destination of the title. Unfortunately, the Bankies “never showed up” and went down meekly 2-0. The consolation of promotion would take some time to realise as the title was lost on goal difference. On reflection, the goal of reaching the top level was a tremendous achievement for a club owned by the fans and the challenge was now to stay there.  
  2011-12 From a purely footballing stand point this season was an absolute joy. With the pressure of seeking promotion finally gone, and the thrill of playing the top names in Junior football, the Bankies suddenly played with a freedom not seen since the innocent days of the first season. Despite a poor start the signs were that this was a side on the up. Finally the goals rained in as sides like Beith, Pollok, Rob Roy, Largs and Irvine Meadow were all not just beaten but played off the park. The Bankies ended the season with eight straight league wins and a credible fourth place finish. The players certainly deserved something for their efforts and the Central League Cup was taken for the second time in three years with a comprehensive 3-0 victory over Scottish Cup winners Shotts Bon Accord. All in the Bankies won 13 games in a row in a quite fantastic season  
  2012-13 With the loss of key players, the job for Budgie McGhie steering the club into it’s tenth season was to consolidate top flight football. In the end up this was achieved quite comfortably and an improved finish of third place was achieved. The football wasn’t as pretty as the previous season and without ever hitting the heights the club were always on course for a top half finish. Auchinleck Talbot were head and shoulders above everyone else, but it is plain to see how far the Bankies have come in the past decade. The cup competitions disappointed and the goal will be to combine league and cup success.  
  2013-14 A successful season from the get-go, Bankies won eight of their first nine games as they lifted the Sectional League Cup against Pollok. Winning 10 of 22 games, Clydebank finished fourth in table. The season was topped off with another trophy, this time the Central League Cup and Bankies beat Cumbernauld United 3-0 at Newlandsfield.  
  2014-15 The worst season in recent years as Bankies were relegated from the Super League Premier Division. Exited all cup competitions to lower league opposition including Craigmark Burtonians, Shettleston and Vale of Clyde. Just two wins all season saw Bankies relegated following a dismal 6-0 loss away to Kilbirnie Ladeside.  
  The History of Chelsea Football Club  
  Apr 30, 2014

  On March 10th 1905, Chelsea Football Club was founded in The Rising Sun pub on Fulham Road. Just a year before that, businessman Gus Mears had purchased the Stamford Bridge athletics complex and was looking to turn it in to a football ground. Mears offered the ground to Fulham FC, which was founded in 1879, but the club refused his offer. Undeterred, Mears decided to form his own club and debated calling it Stamford Bridge FC, London FC, or Kensington FC but eventually decided on Chelsea FC, naming the club after the borough adjacent to Fulham.

  Chelsea spent much of the next century experiencing success primarily in cup competitions with their only top flight league championship before 2005 coming in 1955. The club became known for signing big name players but never consistently experiencing big time success. They were relegated and bounced back up to the top flight in the early years but faced their bleakest period in the late 70s and 80s. Relegation to the Third Division was a very real prospect in 1982 with the club finishing 18th out of 22 but the following year Chelsea won the Second Division and earned their promotion. In the 1987-88 season the club was relegated again but bounced back by winning the Second Division in 88-89 and have remained in the top flight ever since.  
  cfc old /  
  Many point to the appointment of Ruud Gullit as player-manager the turning point as the Dutchman was able to attract major stars from all over Europe to come and play for the Blues. The club began to establish itself among Europe’s best and made its first appearance in the Champions League in 1999. Chelsea had been invited to participate in the inaugural European Cup in 1955 but had not been allowed to compete by the head of the FA at the time Alan Hardaker. The Blues made an impression in the Champions League but never really threatened to win it in the early days.  
  In 2002-03, Chelsea qualified for the Champions League by beating Liverpool on the last day of the season to finish fourth in the league. Many believe that had Chelsea not quialified that day that Roman Abramovich would not have purchased the club. Since Abramovich has taken over the club has reached new heights and is firmly established as one of the elite clubs in world football. The club cemented that elite status when the Blues captured the 2012 Champions League title. The detractors say that Chelsea is a club without a history but it is hard to pay much attention to the past when your present and future is so bright.

  Soccer History Of Chelsea FC  
  Chelsea is a professional soccer team that competes in the English Premier League. The London based club is nicknamed The Blues.  
  Chelsea was founded in 1905 by Gus Mears. They are a regular title contender and one of Europe top sides. Their hunger for trophies can be justified by their frequent contention for the English Premier League title and their presence in Europe top competitions. Chelsea is one of the most decorated teams in England. They have 6 English league titles, 8 FA Cups, and 5 Football League Cup/EFL Cup trophies.  
  Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea, has changed the course of the team’s history since his arrival. The club’s past has not always been that flourishing. To learn more about the club’s old days, let us dive right into the foundation of Chelsea.  
  The Foundation Of Chelsea  
  In 1896, Henry Augustus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge Athletics Complex based in West London, Fulham. After failing to find a soccer team for occupying the ground, Mears and other business people decided to form their own soccer club. Hence, on 10 March 1905, Chelsea Football Club was founded.  
  The Stamford Bridge stadium is Chelsea’s home ground since its formation. During the year 1910, The Blues were already renowned, recording crowds of over 40,000 people. This immense support and popularity enabled the club to attract and sign star players.  
  However, despite that massive support and big-name signings, Chelsea FC’s success was not to come for a long time.  
  The Blues Early Years And Silverwares  
  Indeed, the early years of Chelsea FC were rather forgettable ones, as the club swung between the First and the Second Division. The closest the club came to winning silverware was in the FA Cup during 1915 and 1939. Sheffield United and Newcastle United came out as winners on both occasions.  
  Chelsea’s first significant success arrived under the management of Ted Drake. The latter was appointed as manager in 1952 and delivered within three years. Despite a poor start to the league campaign, the team managed a remarkable run of 25 games, losing only three times, to win their first-ever league title.  
  Drake was not able to repeat the same level of performance in the years that followed. In 1961, he was eventually sacked. In 1965, under the leadership of Tommy Docherty, the club clinched the League Cup.  
  The next success for Chelsea came in the FA Cup in 1970. Dave Sexton guided the team to a victory over Leeds United. The FA Cup win guaranteed the club’s first participation in the UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup. Chelsea FC did not disappoint as they defeated Real Madrid by 3-2 on aggregate in the two-legged final to land their first-ever European trophy.  
  The Decline And Battle For Stamford Bridge  
  Chelsea suffered relegation in 1975 following a period of decline. The Blues appointed and sacked four different managers in 6 years, as the club struggled in the second tier of the football league. Off-field problems further marred the club’s on-field crisis.  
  Firstly, the plan to renovate its stadium was struck by the world economic crisis. With strikes and inflation, the club’s debts rose at their highest in 1977, leading to an inability to buy any player from August 1974 to June 1978.  
  Secondly, the club saw a massive decline in attendances, resulting in an enormous drop in its income. This club’s crisis was further escalated in the mid-1970s when many Chelsea fans were banned from attending away matches following several acts of violence and vandalism during soccer games.  
  In 1981, with the club’s debts growing out of hands, the Mears family finally sold their interest to Ken Bates for £1. However, Bates only acquired the club and not the Stamford Bridge freehold, which still belonged to SB Properties. Following negotiations with David Mears, the majority shareholder of SB Properties, Bates managed to secure a seven-year lease to keep Chelsea FC at Stamford Bridge.  
  Unfortunately, Marler Estates later purchased SB Properties, which resulted in a decade of legal battle between Marler and Bates. Luckily, Cabra Estates, who bought Marler in 1989, became insolvent following the property market crash in 1992. It allowed Ken Bates to deal with Cabra Estates’ creditors and acquired the stadium’s freehold and the naming rights to ensure that no one could purchase Stamford Bridge again.  
  The Revival Of The Blues  
  While the change of ownership and the legal battle to acquire Stamford Bridge was in the limelight, The Blues started to revive their performances on the field. With several key players’ acquisition, the club, managed by John Neal, was promoted to the First Division in 1984.  
  Chelsea appointed Glen Hoddle as their new manager in 1993. Hoddle signed several players that became instrumental in the future success of the club. Ruud Gullit, Mark Hughes, and Dan Petrescu were all recruited during Hoddle’s regime; before the latter stepped down to join the England national team as manager.  
  Following his resignation, club star Ruud Gullit became the player-manager of the club. Gullit followed his predecessor’s steps by signing several big names, including Gianluca Vialli, Frank Leboeuf, Gianfranco Zola, Roberto Di Matteo, Gus Poyet, and Tore Andre Flo. As history has shown, these gifted players transformed Chelsea into one of England’s top clubs.  
  In Gullit’s first season, The Blues ended a 26-year trophy drought by winning the FA Cup against Middlesbrough FC. The club played one of the most attractive soccer in the country during Gullit’s tenure.  
  Unfortunately, due to a contract dispute, Gullit was sacked in February 1988, and the club finished second in the Premier League. Gianluca Vialli, another star player, took over the managerial seat. He immediately conquered the fans by winning both the League Cup and the UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup within two months of his appointment.  
  Vialli’s success continued as the team won the Super Cup final by 1-0 against European champions Real Madrid. During Vialli’s tenure, Chelsea FC became the first English side to field a starting 11 composed entirely of international players.  
  Despite a disappointing 1999-2000 Premier League campaign, the club managed to win the FA Cup against Aston Villa. They also won the Charity Shield by defeating Manchester United by 2-0. With several trophies on his account, Vialli became the most successful manager of Chelsea during that period.  
  The New Millennium And Roman Abramovich  
  In September 2000, the club parted ways with Vialli and appointed Claudio Ranieri as the new manager. Though the club’s league progress was stagnant, Ranieri’s team, which included John Terry, Frank Lampard, and William Gallas, was more convincing in cup competitions.  
  In his second campaign, Ranieri came close to winning the FA Cup, only to lose to London rival Arsenal FC. On the other hand, the club faced a financial crisis, which meant that Ranieri could not sign any new players in the 2002-03 campaign. Ken Bates, the owner, was unable to ease Chelsea FC’s debt burden and eventually sold the club to Roman Abramovich in 2003.  
  The Russian billionaire bought the club and took the responsibility of paying back all Chelsea FC debts. Upon his arrival, Abramovich promised he would turn Chelsea’s fortune and make them one of the world’s best teams.  
  His ambitious journey began instantly as he invested over £100 million to bring players like Claude Makelele, Hernan Crespo, Glen Johnson, Joe Cole, and Damien Duff. The spending had an immediate impact as the club finished as runners-up in the league, which was the team’s best position in 49 years. In the same season, The Blues reached the UEFA Champions League’s semi-final, unfortunately, lost to AS Monaco FC.  
  Abramovich, known as a shrewd and successful businessman, was not pleased to end the season empty-handed. The Russian had his eyes set on the highest price and eventually brought many changes to the management team and backroom staff. As a consequence, despite his heroics with the club, Claudio Ranieri was sacked.  
  The Appointment Of Jose Mourinho – The Special One  
  Claudio Ranieri, who received a well-deserved farewell by Chelsea FC, was replaced by Jose Mourinho. The Special One, as Mourinho proclaimed himself, delivered on his very first season with the club.  
  The 2004-05 campaign was one of Chelsea FC’s most successful seasons, as the Blues won both the Premier League and the League Cup. Backed by Abramovich’s spending prowess, Mourinho signed several important figures, like Didier Drogba, Petr Cech, Arjen Robben, Paulo Ferreira, and Ricardo Carvalho, to support a somehow already impressive squad.  
  In his second season, Mourinho retained the league title. However, the club could not manage any cup success as they were knocked out by Barcelona in the Champions League and lost to Liverpool FC in the FA Cup semi-final.  
  In the following season (2006-07), the team finished second in the league behind winners Manchester United. Despite not retaining the Premier League title, Mourinho guided The Blues to a League Cup win over Arsenal FC (2-1) and FA Cup win over Manchester United (1-0).  
  Though the club was a dominant force in English soccer, they could not impose their supremacy in Europe as Liverpool FC knocked them out in the Champions League’s semi-finals.  
  Post Jose Mourinho Era  
  In September 2007, after several months of disagreement between Mourinho and Abramovich, The Special One left the club by mutual consent. Chelsea’s director of soccer, Avram Grant, was announced as his replacement.  
  The campaign under Grant was hectic and exciting as The Blues were well on track to win three major competitions. However, the club finished runners-up in all three. Defeat against London rival Tottenham by 2-1 in the League Cup was followed by Manchester United claiming the league title that year.  
  Chelsea faced local-rival Liverpool FC in the Champions League semi-final. Having lost the semi-finals to the English club twice before, Chelsea FC managed to go through the final for the first time in their history. Unfortunately, the club lost the final on a penalty shootout (1-1 a.e.t) in an all English contest against Manchester United.  
  Following the 2007-08 campaign, Luiz Felipe Scolari replaced Avram Grant. The latter, who won the World Cup with Brazil in 2002, was touted to bring back success to the club. After a promising start to his career, the club’s performances deteriorated, leading to his sacking in February 2009.  
  Subsequently, Guus Hiddink was appointed as caretaker manager and guided the club to a third-place finish. Hiddink helped The Blues win the FA Cup final with a 2-1 victory over Everton FC.  
  Unfortunately, the Champions League was still out of reach of the club. This time Chelsea FC was knocked out in the semi-finals by Barcelona. Despite being the most consistent club in the Champions League over the last five years, Chelsea FC could not lift the most prestigious trophy in Europe.  
  He reiterated the feat of Mourinho by winning the Premier League title in his first season at the club. The Premier League crown was followed with the FA Cup win over Portsmouth, thus completing a first-ever league title and FA Cup double for The Blues.  
  In the 2010-11 campaign, Ancelloti’s side started the campaign with a loss in the Community Shield against Manchester United. Despite a brilliant start to their Premier League defence, Chelsea could not retain their crown, resulting in the sacking of Ancelotti.  
  Chelsea FC Are Double European Champions  
  In June 2011, Chelsea appointed Andre Villas-Boas as their new manager. The club’s performance under Villa-Boas was inconsistent in the league, and the team was knocked out early in the League Cup by Liverpool FC. With the team lingering fifth in the Premier League table, the FA Cup and Champions League were the only achievable targets. The club sacked Andre Villa-Boas after only nine months at the club.  
  Roberto Di Matteo, a former star player, was appointed as caretaker manager for the rest of the season. The Italian quickly became a fan favorite by helping the team qualify for the FA Cup and Champions League finals.  
  In the FA Cup final, The Blues won a hard-fought game by 2-1 against Liverpool FC.  
  Next up was the UEFA Champions League final against Bayern Munich. It was a much-contested game, and it took over 80 minutes to witness the first goal. Thomas Muller of Bayern scored in the 83rd minute. However, five minutes later, prolific striker Didier Drogba scored a fantastic header to push the game into extra-time.  
  The extra-time ended with no goal. With the penalty shootouts remaining, both teams had equal chances to claim the big ear trophy. Cech made two crucial penalty saves, leaving the team with one spot-kick away from history. Drogba took the decisive penalty to clinch the missing trophy for Chelsea FC.  
  After his heroic with the club, Roberto Di Matteo’s appointment was made permanent. During that period, the club made several vital signings like Eden Hazard, Oscar, Gary Cahill, and Cesar Azpilicueta. However, Chelsea sacked Di Matteo in November 2012 due to poor performances. The interim manager, Rafael Benitez, replaced him.  
  Despite losing the Club World Cup Final to Corinthians and knocked out at the Champions League’s group stage, Benitez led the team to a third position finish in the league, ensuring qualification for the next season’s Champions League. The Spaniard most significant contribution came in the UEFA Europa League, in which The Blues defeated Benfica by 2-1.  
  The Return Of Jose Mourinho At Stamford Bridge  
  The club announced the re-appointment of Jose Mourinho as the manager following the departure of Rafael Benitez. In his first year with the club (2013-14), Chelsea FC finished the campaign empty-handed. By the culmination of the season, Mourinho brought in Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa to further improve the squad.  
  Eventually, in the next campaign, The Blues won the Premier League title after topping the table from the beginning of the campaign. Mourinho also won the club’s fifth League Cup with a 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur. However, the following season saw a completely different image of the team.  
  A poor run of form saw the club win only 5 out of 19 games, which resulted in the sacking of Mourinho in December 2015.  
  Subsequently, Guus Hiddink became the caretaker manager for a second time. By the end of the season, Antonio Conte, former Juventus FC and Italy national team head coach, was appointed to lead the club’s revival.  
  In his first season, Conte signed N’Golo Kante, who played a pivotal role in winning back the Premier League title. Unfortunately, the club’s performance worsened again in the next season. The Blues finished fifth in the league. Exit from the League Cup and the Champions League arrived too soon. The season’s only satisfaction came in the FA Cup win over Manchester United, with Eden Hazard’s goal enough to settle the contest.  
  The failure to qualify for the next season’s Champions League and the ongoing feud between Conte and Diego Costa resulted in the manager’s sacking. Maurizio Sarri subsequently replaced Antonio Conte in July 2018.  
  Sarri made an impressive start to his career. However, the club’s form dipped again, and by February, the club was out of the Premier League contest. Despite being knocked out by Manchester United at home in the FA Cup and calls for the club to sack Sarri, the Italian managed a third-place finish in the league to guarantee participation in the next season’s Champions League.  
  The same season, the club booked their place in the EFL Cup finals and the Europa League. Despite losing in a penalty shootout to Manchester City in the EFL Cup, The Blues won the Europa League over London rivals Arsenal FC by 4-1.  
  Chelsea FC Transfer Ban By FIFA  
  In February 2019, Chelsea FC was banned and fined by FIFA to breach regulations relating to international players’ signing and registration under 18. One case that came to the limelight was Bertrand Traore’s move from his homeland, Burkina Faso, to Chelsea FC.  
  Before his official registration with Chelsea FC, Traore played several years for the club. According to FIFA, 69 academy players were involved in these breaches over several years. Chelsea FC was banned from signing and registering any national and international players for two consecutive years and fined 600,000 Swiss francs.  
  Consequently, the club contested FIFA’s decision and brought their case before the FIFA Appeal Committee. FIFA subsequently rejected the appeal, which was heard in April 2019.  
  However, Chelsea further appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). In December 2019, the CAS concluded that although The Blues violated FIFA rules, the players concerned in the breach were significantly smaller than the number initially claimed. Besides, the CAS found some violations to be less severe than those initially attributed by FIFA.  
  As a result, the ban was reduced to only one year, and the fine was halved to 300,000 Swiss francs.  
  Frank Lampard As The Blues Manager  
  While the club and the people associated with Chelsea FC were shocked by FIFA’s initial transfer ban, Maurizio Sarri left The Blues for Juventus FC. In June 2019, following the Italian departure, Chelsea FC appointed Frank Lampard, former star player and club legend, as the new head coach on a 3-year contract.  
  Backed by Roman Abramovich, Lampard signed big players like Timo Werner, Kai Havertz, Hakim Ziyech, Thiago Silva, Ben Chilwell, and Édouard Mendy. Despite an influx of talents into the team, Lampard started the season slowly. After a series of poor results, he was eventually sacked after 18 months in charge of The Blues.  
  Thomas Tuchel And Chelsea F.C.  
  Thomas Tuchel, who previously coached Paris St-Germain, was appointed as Chelsea new manager on January 26, 2021. His appointment has been quite fruitful as he managed to qualify The Blues for the Champions League semi-finals. In the English Premier League, Chelsea is performing well and looking for a top-four finish.  
  In 1904, Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium in Fulham with the aim of turning it into a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham F.C. was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were also considered.[1] Chelsea F.C. was founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook),[2][3] opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.  
  Chelsea won promotion to the First Division in their second season, and yo-yoed between the First and Second Divisions in their early years. They reached the 1915 FA Cup Final, where they lost to Sheffield United at Old Trafford, and finished third in the First Division in 1920, the club's best league campaign to that point.[4] Chelsea had a reputation for signing star players[5] and attracted large crowds. The club had the highest average attendance in English football in ten separate seasons[6] including 1907–08,[7] 1909–10,[8] 1911–12,[9] 1912–13,[10] 1913–14[11] and 1919–20.[12][13] They were FA Cup semi-finalists in 1920 and 1932 and remained in the First Division throughout the 1930s, but success eluded the club in the inter-war years.  
  In 1896, Henry Augustus "Gus" Mears, football enthusiast and businessman, along with his brother, Joseph Mears, purchased the Stamford Bridge Athletics Ground in Fulham, West London, with the intention of staging first-class football matches there. They had to wait until 1904 to buy the freehold, when the previous owner died. They failed to persuade Fulham Football Club to adopt the ground as their home after a dispute over the rent, so Mears considered selling to the Great Western Railway Company, who wanted to use the land as a coal-dumping yard. Mears' colleague Fred Parker was trying unsuccessfully to dissuade him. Parker later recounted what happened next:  
  Feeling sad that the old ground would be no more, I walked slowly by his [Mears'] side when his dog, coming up from behind unobserved, bit me so severely through my cycling stockings as to draw blood freely. On telling the owner "Your damned dog has bitten me, look!" and showing him the blood, instead of expressing concern he casually observed, "Scotch terrier; always bites before he speaks."  
  The utter absurdity of the remark struck me as so genuinely funny that although hopping about on one foot and feeling blood trickling down, I had to laugh heartily and tell him he was the "coolest fish" I'd ever met.  
  A minute later he surprised me by slapping me on the shoulder and saying, "You took that bite damned well, most men would have kicked up hell about it. Look here, I'll stand on you; never mind the others. Go to the chemists and get that bite seen to and meet me here at nine tomorrow morning and we'll get busy".[14]  
  Thus on a whim, Mears changed his mind and decided to take Parker's advice to instead found his own football club to occupy Stamford Bridge.  
  Chelsea Football Club were founded on 10 March 1905.[2] at The Rising Sun pub, (now The Butcher's Hook) opposite today's main entrance to the ground on the Fulham Road. Since there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough, the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea, was settled on after London FC, Kensington FC and Stamford Bridge FC had been rejected.[15] Blue shirts were adopted by Mears, after the racing colors of Lord Chelsea, along with white shorts and dark blue socks.  
  Chelsea initially considering joining the Southern League, but were rejected following objections from Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur, so they instead applied for admission to the Football League. Their candidacy was endorsed at the Football League AGM on 29 May 1905; a speech by Parker was particularly important, emphasising the new club's financial stability, its impressive new stadium and marquee players such as William "Fatty" Foulke, the 22 stone goalkeeper who had won a league title and two FA Cups with Sheffield United.  
  Twenty-eight-year-old Scottish international half-back John Robertson was hired as player-manager. The club began with established players recruited from other teams; along with Foulke, Chelsea signed forwards Jimmy Windridge and Bob McRoberts from Small Heath, and Frank Pearson from Manchester City. Chelsea's first league match took place away at Stockport County on 2 September 1905. They lost the game 1–0.[16] Their first home match was against Liverpool in a friendly. They won 4–0. Robertson also scored Chelsea's first competitive goal, coming in a 1–0 win against Blackpool.[17]  
  Chelsea finished a respectable 3rd in the Second Division in their first season, but Robertson steadily saw his position undermined by board room interference. He lost the power to select the team in November 1905, and by January 1907 he had left for Glossop.[18] Club secretary William Lewis took temporary charge and led the team to promotion at the end of the season, thanks largely to the goals of Windridge and George "Gatling Gun" Hilsdon. The latter was the first of many prolific strikers/forwards to play for Chelsea; he scored five goals on his debut and 27 in the promotion season en route to becoming the first player to score 100 goals for the club.  
  Lewis was succeeded by David Calderhead, who was to manage Chelsea for the next 26 years. The club's early seasons produced little success, and they yo-yoed between the First and Second divisions. They were relegated in 1909–10, promoted in 1911–12 and finished 19th in 1914–15, the final competitive season before football in England was suspended owing to World War I. The club would normally have been relegated, but when regular football resumed in 1919 the league was expanded to 22 teams and Chelsea were re-elected to the First Division.  
  In 1915, under the shadow of the First World War, Chelsea reached their first FA Cup final, the so-called "Khaki" cup final, owing to the large number of uniformed soldiers in attendance. The match against Sheffield United was played in a sombre atmosphere and staged at Old Trafford in Manchester to avoid disruption in London. Chelsea, minus their top amateur striker, Vivian Woodward, who had sportingly insisted that the team who reached the final ought to keep their places, were seemingly unnerved by the occasion and outplayed for much of the match. Goalkeeper Jim Molyneux's mistake allowed United to score before half-time, but the Blues held out until the final six minutes, when their opponents added two more to win 3–0.  
  In spite of their checkered fortunes, Chelsea became one of the best-supported teams in the country, with fans attracted by the team's reputation for playing entertaining attacking football and for signing star players, notably half-back Ben Warren and striker Bob Whittingham. The club had the highest average attendance in English football in 1907–08,[19] 1909–10,[20] 1911–12,[21] 1912–13[22] and 1913–14.[23] A crowd of 67,000 attended a league game against Manchester United on Good Friday 1906, a then-record for a football match in London.[24] 55,000 attended the first-ever London derby in the top division, against Woolwich Arsenal, a record for a First Division match. 77,952 attended a fourth round FA Cup tie against Swindon on 13 April 1911.[25]  
  1919–20, the first full season following the war, was Chelsea's most successful up to that point. Led by 24 goal striker Jack Cock, the club's latest glamour signing, they finished third in the league – then the highest league finish for a London club – and reached the FA Cup semi-finals, only to be denied by eventual winners Aston Villa, which saw them miss out on a chance to play in the final at Stamford Bridge. The club were relegated again in 1923–24 and in four of the next five seasons were to narrowly miss out on promotion, finishing fifth, third, fourth and third. With long serving mainstays including Willie Ferguson, Tommy Law and Andy Wilson, Chelsea finally reached the First Division again in 1929–30, where the club was to remain for the next 32 years.  
  To capitalise on the 1930 promotion, the club spent £25,000 ($49,000) on three big-name players: Scots Hughie Gallacher, Alex Jackson and Alec Cheyne. Gallacher in particular was one of the biggest talents of his era, known for his goalscoring and for having captained Newcastle to a championship in 1926–27. He and Jackson had also been members of the Wembley Wizards team (as had Law), the Scotland team which beat England 5–1 at Wembley in 1928.  
  However, though the team occasionally clicked, such as in a 6–2 win over Manchester United and a 5–0 win over Sunderland, none of the trio had the desired impact. Gallacher was Chelsea's top scorer in each of his four seasons, scoring 81 goals in total, but his time in west London was hindered by his personal troubles and punctuated by long suspensions for indiscipline, including a two-month ban for swearing at a referee.[26] Jackson and Cheyne struggled to settle at the club and were unable re-capture their previous achievements. The trio did not make 300 appearances between them and by 1936 all had left at a significant financial loss to the club.[27] Their disappointment epitomised Chelsea's flaws throughout the decade, whereby performances and results rarely matched the calibre of players at the club. Money was spent, but some feel it was too often spent on inappropriate players, especially forwards, while the defence remained neglected.  
  The FA Cup was to be the closest the club came to silverware. In 1932, the team secured impressive wins over Liverpool and Sheffield Wednesday, and were drawn against Newcastle United in the semi-finals. Tommy Lang inspired Newcastle to a 2–0 lead, before Gallacher pulled one back for Chelsea. The Blues laid siege to the United goal in the second half, but were unable to make a breakthrough and the Geordies went on to lift the trophy.  
  Calderhead stepped down in 1933 and was replaced by Leslie Knighton, but the appointment saw little change in Chelsea's fortunes. At different times during the decade the club had on its books such players as Tommy Law, Sam Weaver, Sid Bishop, Harry Burgess, Dick Spence and Joe Bambrick, all established internationals, yet their highest league finish in the decade was eighth. Ironically, two of the club's most reliable players during the decade cost them nothing: goalkeeper Vic Woodley, who was to win 19 consecutive caps for England, and centre-forward George Mills, the first player to score 100 league goals for Chelsea. They avoided relegation by two points in 1932–33 and 1933–34, and by one point in 1938–39. Another promising cup run in 1939, which included wins over Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday, petered out with a home loss to Grimsby Town in the quarter-finals.  
  The club continued to be one of the country's best-supported teams. The visit of Arsenal on 12 October 1935 attracted a crowd of 82,905 to Stamford Bridge, which remains a club record and the second highest ever attendance at an English league match. Crowds of almost 50,000 attended Gallacher and Jackson's home debuts. In 1939, with the club having come no closer to on-field success, Knighton stepped down. He was succeeded by Scotsman and former Queens Park Rangers manager, Billy Birrell.  
  In 1937, Chelsea competed in the "Arts et Techniques dans la Vie moderne" tournament in Paris against some of the biggest clubs of the time, Austria Wien, Bologna and Slavia Prague, thus becoming one of the first English clubs to participate in an international tournament.[28] Chelsea reached the final of the tournament, where they lost to Italian champions Bologna.  
  During the World War One Chelsea club lost many star players.[29]  
  The war, Dynamo and the new youth system (1940–52)[edit]  
  Birrell was appointed Chelsea manager shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War. Three games into the 1939–40 season, first class football was abandoned in Britain for the duration of the conflict, meaning that all wartime results are only regarded as unofficial. Chelsea competed in a series of regional competitions and, like every other club, saw their squad severely depleted by the war effort (only two members of Chelsea's 1938–39 team ever played for them again). The club thus fielded a series of "guest" players, most notably Matt Busby, Walter Winterbottom and Eddie Hapgood. They also competed in the Football League War Cup, during which they made their Wembley debut, losing 1–3 to Charlton Athletic in the 1944 final, and beating Millwall 2–0 a year later in front of crowds of over 80,000. After the latter match, John Harris became the first Chelsea captain to lift a trophy at Wembley, receiving the cup from King George VI.[30][31]  
  In October 1945, with the war having just ended, the English football authorities sought a way to celebrate the return of the peacetime game. As part of a goodwill gesture, it was announced that Dynamo Moscow, reigning champions of the Soviet Union, would tour the United Kingdom and play several home teams, including Chelsea. The match took place on 13 November at Stamford Bridge with Chelsea wearing an unfamiliar red strip due to a clash with Dynamo's blue kit. Before kick-off, the Dynamo players presented a bouquet of flowers to their opposite number.[32] The Russian team surprised many observers with their talent and tenacity by fighting back from 0–2 and 2–3 down to earn a 3–3 draw. An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people attended the match, with thousands entering the ground illegally. This crowd is the highest ever recorded at Stamford Bridge. Spectators watched from numerous obscure places, including many on the dog track and on the top of stands.[33]  
  Following the war, Chelsea again spent big, and again bought three big-name forwards, this time Tommy Lawton, Len Goulden and Tommy Walker, for around £22,000. The trio provided both goals and entertainment – Lawton set a new club record by scoring 26 goals in 34 league games in 1946–47[16] – but Chelsea finished 15th that season and never finished above 13th under Birrell. After a falling out with Birrell, Lawton was sold to Notts County for £20,000; his replacement was Roy Bentley, signed from Newcastle United for £11,500 in 1948.  
  1951 saw Chelsea enjoy another run in the FA Cup. After beating Manchester United 2–0 in a pulsating quarter-final, they were drawn to face London rivals Arsenal at White Hart Lane. Two goals from Bentley put Chelsea in control, but a freak goal from Arsenal (Chelsea's goalkeeper misjudged a corner and punched it into his own net) just before half-time turned the game. Arsenal equalised 15 minutes from full-time and then won the replay 1–0.  
  A year later, Chelsea seemed destined for relegation: with four games remaining, they were six points behind, at the bottom of the table, and without a win in fourteen matches. After unexpectedly winning the first three, Chelsea went into their final match needing to beat Bolton Wanderers and hoping for the right result between fellow relegation candidates Everton and Sheffield Wednesday. Chelsea won 4–0 and Wednesday beat Everton 6–0, thus ensuring Chelsea's survival on goal average by 0.044 of a goal.[16] In 1952, Chelsea again faced Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-finals and after a 1–1 tie in the first match, lost the replay 3–0. Birrell resigned shortly afterwards.

  In 2003, Chelsea were bought by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, ushering in an era of substantial success. José Mourinho led them to two league titles, an FA Cup and two League Cups in three seasons. The club added a further FA Cup in 2009, and then their first League and FA Cup "Double" in 2010. Under the stewardship of former player Roberto Di Matteo, the club won a seventh FA Cup in 2012, before winning their first UEFA Champions League title. Followed by their first UEFA Europa League victory a year after. Further Premier League victories followed in 2015 and 2017. They won their 8th FA Cup in 2018 and a second Europa League in 2019. This was followed by a second UEFA Champions League victory in 2021. In March 2022, Chelsea was seized from Abramovich after sanctions imposed by the British government. On 30 May 2022, the £4.25 billion Todd Boehly-led consortium announced completion of the ownership transfer of Chelsea, ending Abramovich's 19 year ownership of the club.[1]  
  With the club facing an apparent financial crisis,[2] Bates unexpectedly sold Chelsea F.C. in June 2003 for £60 million.[3] In so doing, he reportedly recognised a personal profit of £17 million on the club he had bought for £1 in 1982 (his stake had been diluted to just below 30% over the years).[4] The club's new owner was Russian oligarch and billionaire Roman Abramovich, who also took on responsibility for the club's debt, in the region of £80 million, quickly paying some of it.[5] He then went on a £100 million spending spree before the start of the season and landed players like Claude Makélélé, Geremi, Hernán Crespo, Wayne Bridge, Glen Johnson, Joe Cole and Damien Duff.[6]  
  The spending saw a good return, with Chelsea finishing as Premier League runners-up (their best league finish for 49 years) and reaching the Champions League semi-finals after dramatically beating the Arsenal Invincibles in the quarter-finals.[7] However, Chelsea lost the semi-final to Monaco;[8] with manager Claudio Ranieri criticised for some tactical decisions such as switching central midfielder Scott Parker to right-back and right-back Glen Johnson to centre-back to accommodate more attackers in the team).[9] Ranieri was eventually sacked and replaced by José Mourinho (who had lifted two Portuguese league titles, a Portuguese Cup, a Champions League title and a UEFA Cup with Porto) as the club's new manager.[10]  
  José Mourinho: double League Champions (2004–07)[edit]  
  2004–05 was a successful season despite a slow start to the league season, trailing leaders Arsenal by five points.[citation needed] Chelsea's title campaign gradually picked up momentum, driven by the high-scoring Frank Lampard and the return from injury of talented young Dutch winger Arjen Robben.[citation needed] They topped the table after a win against Everton in November 2004 and never relinquished their lead, losing only one league game all season and winning a record 29, gaining a record 95 points in the process.[citation needed] A record-breaking defence, led by captain John Terry and his new partnership with Ricardo Carvalho, the versatile William Gallas, fullback Paulo Ferreira, midfield linchpin Claude Makélélé and goalkeeper Petr Čech, provided the backbone of the side, conceding just 15 goals all season and keeping 25 clean sheets[citation needed] while Čech went a Premier League-record 1,025 minutes without conceding a goal.[11][12] Chelsea eventually secured the title with a 2–0 away win at Bolton thanks to two goals from Lampard, almost 50 years to the day since they had won their last league title.[13] Winning the league completed a domestic double for the club, since Chelsea had already won the League Cup in February after a thrilling 3–2 win over Liverpool in the Final at the Millennium Stadium.[14]  
  In the Champions League, Chelsea were drawn against Barcelona in the knockout round. In the first leg at the Camp Nou, Chelsea took a 1–0 lead but had Didier Drogba controversially sent-off in the second half with Chelsea still ahead, and the Catalans eventually won 2–1.[15] Mourinho claimed that Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard had spoken to referee Anders Frisk at half-time – a claim later proved correct – and that the result had been "adulterated".[16] After receiving death threats from Chelsea fans, Frisk retired and Mourinho received a two-match touchline ban for bringing the game into disrepute.[17][18] Chelsea won a pulsating return leg 4–2 at Stamford Bridge, with John Terry heading in a controversial winner to send them through.[19] In the quarter-finals, a 4–2 home win over German champions Bayern Munich and a 3–2 loss in Germany were enough to ensure passage through to the semi-finals, where they faced Liverpool.[20] Following a 0–0 draw at Stamford Bridge, Liverpool went 1–0 up at Anfield thanks to Luis García and Chelsea were unable to break down a resilient defence, thus missing out on the chance of a treble.[21]  
  Chelsea's Centenary XI, selected by fans in 2005[22]  
  A year later Chelsea retained their league title, signing Shaun Wright-Phillips in the summer for £21 million and setting more records in the process.[23] Winning their first nine games,[citation needed] the side emphatically set the pace in the Premier League – including a 4–1 win over Liverpool at Anfield –[24] and at one stage were 18 points ahead of nearest rivals Manchester United.[citation needed] Following a late-season blip, and with United on a run of nine consecutive wins,[citation needed] the points gap was closed to seven points as Chelsea went into a key match with West Ham. A goal down after ten minutes and a man down after 17 following Maniche's sending off, the side bounced back to win 4–1 and maintain the gap.[25] The title was eventually secured with a 3–0 win over United at Stamford Bridge.[26] They became the first London club to win back-to-back league titles since the 1930s, and only the fifth side to do so since the Second World War.[citation needed] They also set the record for the most clean sheets (six) from the start of the season and equalled the best home record for a top division team since Newcastle United in 1906–07 (18 wins and 1 draw from 19 games).[citation needed] In the cups, however, there was less success as they were knocked out of the Champions League by Barcelona and the FA Cup semi-final by Liverpool.[27][28]  
  Despite the arrival of Ashley Cole, Michael Ballack and Andriy Shevchenko the 2006–07 season saw Chelsea relinquish the Premier League trophy to Manchester United after remaining second in the league for the majority of the season.[29][30] The club were still in the running to achieve an unprecedented quadruple at the end of April, and played all but one of the maximum 63 possible games at the start of the season.[citation needed] They won the League Cup by beating Arsenal 2–1 in the last ever English cup Final at the Millennium Stadium,[31] and beat United 1–0 in the first FA Cup Final at the new Wembley Stadium;[32] Chelsea were also the last team to win it at the old Wembley. They reached the semi-finals of the Champions League, only to be knocked out again by Liverpool, this time in a penalty shoot-out.[33]  
  On 20 September 2007, Mourinho left Chelsea by "mutual consent"[34] following an indifferent start to the season and after several months of well-documented friction between Mourinho and Abramovich.[35] Shortly afterwards, Israeli Avram Grant, who had been appointed Chelsea's director of football on 8 July 2007,[36] was announced as Mourinho's successor.[37]  
  Despite the managerial upheaval and a high level of player absence (in all, members of the team were unavailable for selection 286 times in the 62 fixtures),[38] Chelsea were on course to win three different competitions, a feat previously achieved by only two other English clubs, Liverpool in 1983–84 and Manchester United in 1998–99, but ultimately finished as runners-up in all three.[citation needed] Chelsea reached their third League Cup final in four years, but suffered a surprise 2–1 defeat to mid-table Tottenham at Wembley.[39] Chelsea emerged as United's closest rivals in the title race; a 2–1 victory over United at Stamford Bridge in April left the teams level on points with four games remaining.[40] The teams were still level on points going into the final game of the season, although United's superior goal difference meant Chelsea had to better their result; in the event, Chelsea drew 1–1 with Bolton Wanderers and United beat Wigan Athletic to take the title.[41]  
  Grant also led Chelsea to their fourth Champions League semi-final in five years, and they were again drawn to face Liverpool, although this time it was Chelsea who prevailed, winning 4–3 on aggregate to reach the Final for the first time in their history.[42] Their opponents in the Final were Manchester United, making it the first all-English final in the competition's history.[43] In an even game, Lampard's first-half strike cancelled out Cristiano Ronaldo's opener, and the teams remained at 1–1 for the rest of the match, taking the final to a penalty shootout, where John Terry and Nicolas Anelka's misses from the spot gave United victory.[44]  
  After the conclusion of the 2007–08 season, Chelsea became the highest ranked club under UEFA's five-year coefficient system used in the seeding of European club competitions in the following season, a sign of the consistency of the club's performance over the first five years of Roman Abramovich's ownership.[45]  
  Grant was sacked as Chelsea manager three days later.[46] Grant's replacement was Brazilian Luiz Felipe Scolari, who had guided Brazil to victory at the 2002 World Cup and Portugal to runners-up at UEFA Euro 2004.[47] However, despite a bright start which saw Chelsea top the Premier League table early in the season, Scolari was sacked on 9 February 2009 due to "results and performances of the team... deteriorating at a key time in the season", and with the club lying fourth in the Premier League.[48] Russia national team coach Guus Hiddink was appointed caretaker manager until the end of the season. Under Hiddink, performances and results improved; Chelsea lost just one more game all season, eventually finishing third in the league and reaching the FA Cup Final.[49][50]  
  In the Champions League, a 7–5 aggregate win over Liverpool in the quarter-finals, including an epic 4–4 draw at Stamford Bridge, took Chelsea to another semi-final, against Barcelona.[51] After drawing 0–0 in the first leg at the Camp Nou, Chelsea took an early lead in the second through Michael Essien, but in a controversial game in which Chelsea squandered numerous chances and had several penalty appeals turned down, a stoppage time equaliser from Andrés Iniesta sent Barcelona through on away goals.[52] In the immediate aftermath, Drogba caused more controversy after swearing at referee Tom Henning Øvrebø.[53] In consolation, goals from Drogba and Lampard gave Chelsea a 2–1 victory over Everton in the FA Cup Final at Wembley on 30 May, the club's second FA Cup triumph in three years.[54]  
  Former Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti was confirmed as Hiddink's successor on 1 June 2009.[55] He started his career by winning the World Football Challenge, played in the United States.[56] In Ancelotti's first competitive match, Chelsea met Manchester United in the Community Shield. The game ended in a 2–2 draw, with Chelsea winning 4–1 on penalties to take the trophy, the club's first victory in a shoot-out since beating Ipswich Town in the League Cup in January 1998.[57]  
  On 3 September 2009, in a rare but not unprecedented punishment, Chelsea were banned from registering any new players for the next two transfer windows, in January and Summer 2010, after FIFA's dispute resolution chamber (DRC) ruled that French winger Gaël Kakuta had breached his contract with French club Lens when he joined Chelsea in 2007, and that Chelsea had induced him to do so.[58] The club were subsequently cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and the transfer ban was lifted.[59]  
  At the end of a season in which Chelsea exchanged places at the top of the table with Manchester United several times, and were briefly leapfrogged by Arsenal, they sealed their third Premier League title in six seasons with an emphatic 8–0 home win over Wigan on the final day of the season.[60] The win also took Chelsea's league goal tally for the season to 103,[61] the highest since Tottenham Hotspur scored 111 in the 1962–63 season, and the first time in Premier League history that a club had scored 100 or more goals in a season.[62] Drogba, Lampard, Anelka and Florent Malouda all scored double figures.[citation needed] A week later, Chelsea completed the first "league title and FA Cup double" in their history by beating Portsmouth 1–0 in the FA Cup Final, thanks to a Didier Drogba free kick, his seventh goal in six cup finals for Chelsea.[63]  
  Chelsea began the 2010–11 season with a loss to Manchester United in the Community Shield.[64] Chelsea's Premier League season started well with wins in their opening five League games,[65] two by a 6–0 scoreline,[66][67] although a dip in form saw them fighting to stay in the top four.[68] On 31 January, Chelsea made headlines by signing a pair of stars in the final moments of the January transfer window, David Luiz for £21.3 m from Benfica and a British transfer record of £50 m for Liverpool's Fernando Torres.[69] The two signings proved not to be enough to salvage something from Chelsea's season and they failed to win a trophy. As a result, Ancelotti was dismissed as manager shortly after Chelsea's 1–0 defeat to Everton on the final day of the season.[70]  
  On 22 June 2011, André Villas-Boas was appointed as the new Chelsea manager on a three-year contract, with immediate effect.[71][72] On 14 August, Chelsea drew 0–0 their first match of the 2011–12 Premier League season away to Stoke City. Villas-Boas won his first match as Chelsea manager the following week after the Blues beat West Bromwich Albion 2–1. On 22 August, Chelsea and Valencia agreed a deal for Spanish international winger Juan Mata, who signed for £23.5 million.[73] On transfer deadline day, Raul Meireles joined the Blues from Liverpool, while Gaël Kakuta joined Bolton on loan until 1 January 2012. On 18 September, Chelsea suffered their first defeat of the season, losing 3–1 to Manchester United at Old Trafford.  
  On 29 November 2011, Chelsea were knocked out of the League Cup at the quarter-final stage by Liverpool, who won 2–0 at Stamford Bridge. The loss was Chelsea's third in four games. Four days later, Villas-Boas confirmed the departures of Nicolas Anelka and Alex, both of whom had handed in their respective transfer requests to the club. The announcement was made after the away match against Newcastle which Chelsea won 3–0, putting them back into the Champions League qualification places. On 6 December, Chelsea won their final Champions League group game 3–0 against Valencia, securing progress to the knockout stages. Racing Genk's 1–1 draw against Bayer Leverkusen meant that Chelsea topped Group E. On 12 December, Chelsea inflicted league leaders Manchester City's first league defeat of the season, coming from behind in a fiery encounter with goals from Raul Meireles and a late penalty by Frank Lampard to turn the deficit into a victory. On 21 February 2012, Napoli beat Chelsea 3–1 in the first leg of their round of 16 tie.[74]  
  In March 2012, following a 1–0 defeat against West Brom, André Villas-Boas was sacked as Chelsea manager after nine months in charge; his win percentage was under 50%.[75][76] At the time of his sacking, the team were fifth in the league and on the brink of Champions League elimination after a 3–1 away loss to Napoli.[77] A club statement read that results had "not been good enough and were showing no signs of improving at a key time in the season".[78] Italian first team assistant manager (and former Chelsea player) Roberto Di Matteo was appointed caretaker manager until the end of the season. On 14 March, Chelsea beat Napoli 4–1 in the second leg of their Champions League second round match, overturning a 3–1 deficit from the first leg.[79] The good run of form under Di Matteo continued when Chelsea progressed to the semi-final of the FA Cup after beating Leicester City 5–2 at Stamford Bridge.[80]  
  In April 2012, Chelsea progressed to the Champions League semi-finals for the sixth time in nine seasons, courtesy of a 3–1 aggregate win over Benfica.[81] This set up a tie against holders Barcelona. On 15 April, Chelsea progressed to their third FA Cup Final in four seasons by thrashing rivals Tottenham 5–1 at Wembley;[82] Didier Drogba scored first to extend his incredible record of scoring at every match he'd played there (seven at the time). Three days later, Chelsea faced Barcelona at Stamford Bridge as heavy underdogs. Despite Barcelona dominating possession and having the greater number of chances, Chelsea secured a hard-fought 1–0 win in the first leg.[83] In the return leg a week later at the Camp Nou, Chelsea went 2–0 down and had captain John Terry sent off within the first 45 minutes. However, a goal on the stroke of half-time from Ramires put Chelsea into a leading position, one which they maintained thanks to a Lionel Messi penalty miss. In the dying moments, Fernando Torres scored to clinch a place in the Final, giving Chelsea a 3–2 aggregate win.[84]  
  Despite their progress in the cups, Chelsea's Premier League form remained indifferent, with draws against Tottenham and Arsenal and a home loss to Newcastle effectively ended their chances of finishing in the top four of the League table. This meant that they would have to win the Champions League to secure qualification for the following season's competition. In the 2012 FA Cup Final, Chelsea faced Liverpool. Ramires put Chelsea ahead early in the match, and in the second half Didier Drogba doubled the lead. Despite Liverpool halving the deficit with an Andy Carroll strike, Chelsea held out to win their seventh FA Cup, largely thanks to heroics from goalkeeper Petr Čech, who pulled off an exceptional save to narrowly deny Andy Carroll an equaliser; this was Chelsea's fourth success in the competition in six seasons[85] and the best record of any club in the competition since Wanderers won it five times in seven years in the nineteenth century.  
  In the UEFA Champions League Final, Chelsea's opponents were Bayern Munich. The match was held at the Allianz Arena, Bayern's home ground. Bayern took the lead after 83 minutes through Thomas Müller, but five minutes later Drogba headed in the equaliser – his ninth goal in nine cup finals for Chelsea – to take the game to extra time. Bayern were awarded a penalty, but Arjen Robben's strike was saved by Petr Čech. The game remained 1–1, meaning the match went to a penalty shootout. Bayern took a 3–1 lead after Juan Mata saw his penalty saved, but Bayern's Ivica Olić and Bastian Schweinsteiger's missed their spot-kicks, leaving Drogba to score the decisive spot-kick to clinch Chelsea's first Champions League title in their history.[86] In 2013, the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS) ranked Chelsea the number one team in the world, replacing Barcelona at the top of the world rankings.[87]  
  Roberto Di Matteo was made permanent manager but was sacked in November 2012 and replaced with Rafael Benítez,[88] an unpopular choice with many Chelsea fans owing to Benitez' association with Liverpool and comments he had previously made about the club,[89] and he received a "fiercely hostile reception" as he was introduced at his first home game, a 0–0 draw with Manchester City on 25 November 2012.[90][91] Benítez' tenure saw mixed results; Chelsea lost the Club World Cup Final to Corinthians[92] and were beaten in the League Cup semi-finals by Swansea City.[93] They finished third in the Premier League, ensuring Champions League qualification, and won the UEFA Europa League thanks to goals from Fernando Torres and Branislav Ivanović in the 2013 UEFA Europa League Final.[94][95] In doing so, Chelsea became the first side in history to hold two major European titles simultaneously and the fourth club, and the only British club, to have won all three of UEFA's major club competitions until 2017, when Manchester United won their first UEFA Europa League trophy.[96]  
  On 3 June 2013, Chelsea announced the appointment of José Mourinho as manager for the second time on a four-year contract.[97] Willian arrived soon after in August 2013 and Nemanja Matic was re-signed in the January transfer window.[98][99] In Mourinho's first year back, the 2013–14, Chelsea did not win any silverware but finished 3rd with 82 points, four points behind champions Manchester City.[100] They also reached the Champions League semi-finals, losing 3–1 on aggregate to Atlético Madrid.[101] Another high point of the season was a 6–0 thrashing of Arsenal in March. Chelsea's biggest ever win against their North London rivals.[102]  
  In the close season Chelsea signed midfielder Cesc Fàbregas from Barcelona, striker Diego Costa from Atlético Madrid, and Kurt Zouma from Saint-Étienne.[103] Thibaut Courtois was also recalled from his loan at Atlético Madrid, and David Luiz was sold to Paris Saint-Germain for £50 million, a world record for a defender.[104] Meanwhile, club favourites Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard and Juan Mata left with César Azpilicueta and Oscar being preferred by Mourinho. The following season, Chelsea won the Premier League title for the first time since 2009–10 after topping the table from the very start of the season.[105][citation needed] They did not lose a match until December and ultimately finished eight points clear of runners-up Manchester City.[106] Club captain John Terry played every minute of all 38 games, equalling a record set by Gary Pallister.[107] They also won their fifth League Cup, thanks to a 2–0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley Stadium.[108] However, they would be knocked in the FA Cup fourth round by League One side Bradford City after they led an unexpected comeback at Stamford Bridge to win the game 2–4, and give Chelsea their first loss at home during the entire season.[109]  
  The 2015–16 season saw a poor run of form from the Premier League champions. On 17 December, Mourinho was sacked by the club after a defeat to eventual champions Leicester City which had left Chelsea one point ahead of the relegation zone after 16 games, the worst start to a season since 1978.[110][111] Guus Hiddink was brought in for a second spell as caretaker manager.[112] However, the team continued to struggle and finished tenth in the Premier League, their lowest league placing since 1995–96.[113]  
  Conte and Sarri: fifth Premier League and second Europa League title (2015–19)[edit]  
  After the sacking of Mourinho, Guus Hiddink was named caretaker manager for the remainder of the 2015–16 season.[114] The team went unbeaten in Hiddink's first fifteen games in charge.[115] In February 2016, Chelsea lost to Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16.[116] Chelsea then lost the second leg of the round of 16, losing 2–1 at home thus being knocked out of the competition in March 2016.[117] This was followed by an elimination from the FA Cup later that month after a 2–0 loss to Everton.[118] However, Premier League form improved, with Chelsea rising from 16th, one point away from relegation in December 2015, to eleventh place by February 2016 after a fightback from going 1–0 down to win 2–1 at Southampton.[119][120]  
  However, the team's form began to slip with a 1–1 home draw with Stoke City, and a 2–2 home draw against West Ham, resulting in Chelsea slipping down to tenth.[121][122] In April 2016, Chelsea registered a 4–1 away win at Bournemouth, with Eden Hazard getting on the score sheet for the first time,[123] and after going down 2–0 against rivals Tottenham, fought back to draw 2–2, Hazard again scoring to seal the Premier League for Leicester City.[124] Chelsea drew 1–1 at Liverpool and played out a 1–1 home draw against Leicester City, with Claudio Ranieri, former Chelsea boss, being received a guard of honour.[125][126]  
  Former Juventus and then-Italy national team head coach Antonio Conte was confirmed as new Chelsea manager in March 2016. He took charge for the 2016–17 season following Italy's participation at UEFA Euro 2016.[127] Under Conte, the team performed well in the 2016–17 season, winning the Premier League and setting the record for most wins at the time with 30 of 38 total games in a season.[128] N'Golo Kanté and Marcos Alonso were both signed in the summer whilst David Luiz and Victor Moses re-joined the club to play key roles.[129][130][131]  
  In the subsequent season, Chelsea's form dipped again.[132] In the UEFA Champions League, they finished second in their group after results, including draws at home to Roma and Atletico Madrid and a loss away to Roma.[133] In the round of 16 Chelsea drew Barcelona; after a 1–1 result in the home leg Barcelona came back to win 3–0 at the Nou Camp and knocked Chelsea out of the competition.[134] Fortunes in the EFL Cup were slightly better with the club making it to the semi-finals, but they were knocked out by Arsenal 2–1 on aggregate.[135] The silver lining in the season was the FA Cup win in which a solitary goal from Eden Hazard sealed the Blues' victory over Manchester United at Wembley.[136] However, the failure to qualify for the Champions League, along with manager Antonio Conte's issues of the pitch with striker Diego Costa meant that Antonio Conte was sacked before the start of the following Premier League season.[137][138] He was promptly replaced by fellow Italian Maurizio Sarri for the following season.[139]  
  Maurizio Sarri's first season started well with a 12 match unbeaten run in the Premier League, including 4–0 wins at home to Burnley and a 1–1 draw with eventual second-place finishers Liverpool.[140] However, a dip in form around February meant that a title challenge was out of the question along with a defeat at home in the fifth round of the FA Cup to Manchester United.[141] Despite calls for the club to sack the Italian around this time, Maurizio Sarri steered the club to third place in the league ahead of Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United who had finished above them the previous season.[142] This guaranteed Champions League qualification for the following season.[143] Additionally, Chelsea made it to the Final of the EFL Cup, being beaten by the eventual league winners Manchester City on penalties.[144] The club also made their way to the final of the Europa League, in which they beat Arsenal 4–1 on 29 May 2019 with goals from Hazard, Olivier Giroud and Pedro resulting in their first European trophy since 2013.[145]  
  The club's appeal against a transfer ban levied by FIFA for breaching rules regarding the signing of foreign under-18 players was rejected on 8 May 2019. This meant that the club was to serve a punishment of a transfer ban for two windows. However, the club has stated that it will appeal to the Court of Arbitration for sport.[146] Sarri subsequently departed ahead of the 2019–20 season to take charge of Juventus.[147]  
  Off the pitch, on 29 November 2016, Chelsea became implicated in the UK football sexual abuse scandal after announcing it was investigating allegations of historical sexual abuse in the 1970s, including a secret payment to a former player who had accused the club's ex-chief scout Eddie Heath of child sexual abuse.[148][149][150] On 2 December, the former player was named as Gary Johnson, who said he was paid £50,000 not to go public with allegations he was sexually abused by Heath.[151] The following day, Chelsea apologised "profusely" to Johnson,[152] who later demanded further financial compensation from the club.[153] Also on 3 December, The Independent reported a Chelsea youth player's allegation that Dario Gradi, then Chelsea's assistant manager, visited the player's family's home to "smooth over" a complaint of sexual assault against Heath in 1974.[154] Gradi was among the first to be targeted by a FA enquiry,[155] and, in connection with these allegations, Gradi was suspended by the FA on 11 December 2016.[156][157] Meanwhile, former Chelsea youth goalkeeper Derek Richardson also alleged abuse by Heath.[158] In August 2019, Chelsea's board apologised "unreservedly" for allowing Heath, a "prolific and manipulative sexual abuser", to operate "unchallenged". The apology followed an inquiry led by barrister Charles Geekie QC, who was also critical of former assistant manager Gradi. He was accused of failing to tell senior club staff about a sexual conduct allegation concerning Heath made by the parent of a young player.[159]  
  In January 2020, Chelsea FC unveiled a mural by Solomon Souza on an outside wall of the West Stand at Stamford Bridge stadium. The mural is part of Chelsea's 'Say No to Antisemitism' campaign funded by club owner Roman Abramovich. Included on the mural are depictions of footballers Julius Hirsch and Árpád Weisz, who were killed at Auschwitz concentration camp, and Ron Jones, a British prisoner of war known as the 'Goalkeeper of Auschwitz'.[165]  
  Thomas Tuchel: second Champions League and first Club World Cup titles (2021–22)[edit]  
  Under Tuchel Chelsea went on a good run of form and were unbeaten in Tuchel's first 13 games at the club.[168] Chelsea finished the season in the top four after being 9th in the table when Tuchel arrived.[169] Chelsea also progressed to the FA Cup Final after knocking out Premier League leaders Manchester City, only to lose 1–0 to Leicester City in the Final.[170] Chelsea progressed to the 2021 UEFA Champions League Final after beating Atletico Madrid, Porto, and Real Madrid in the round of 16, quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively.[171] Chelsea won the Champions League for the second time after beating Manchester City 1–0 on May 29, 2021, at Estádio do Dragão in Porto, Portugal with Kai Havertz scoring the winner.[172]  
  Chelsea started strongly in the 2021–22 season. After having won the Champions League, Tuchel guided the club to their second UEFA Super Cup, beating Villarreal 6–5 on penalties after a 1–1 draw.[173] In August 2021, Chelsea broke their club record transfer fee by re-signing Romelu Lukaku for £97.5 million.[174] The club topped the Premier League in December 2021.[175] However, Chelsea's form declined, eventually finishing 3rd, nineteen points behind the leaders.[176] Nonetheless, the club reached the League Cup Final where they lost to Liverpool on penalties after a goalless draw.[177] The club also reached the FA Cup Final against Liverpool again.[178] However, Chelsea lost on penalties again after a 0–0 draw; this was Chelsea's third consecutive FA Cup Final ending in defeat.[179]  
  Sanctions to Abramovich, restrictions and troubles in finding the new owner[edit]  
  "[Chelsea] have been a success machine for the last 10–20 years. That doesn't just come with money, we've seen at Manchester United and Arsenal where they've put billions into the team and not had the success that Chelsea have had. Chelsea can feel comfortable that they'll have rich owners, but will they have football smart owners? Because that's what Abramovich has been.  
  Amidst financial sanctions leveled at Russian oligarchs by Western governments in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Abramovich stated on 26 February that he would hand over the stewardship of Chelsea to the trustees of the Chelsea Foundation.[181] The trustees did not immediately agree, due to legal concerns regarding the rules of the Charity Commission for England and Wales.[182] A week later, Abramovich wrote-off the £1.5 billion the club owed him, and put the club up for sale, pledging to donate net proceeds from it to the victims of the war in Ukraine.[183][184]  
  On 10 March 2022, the British government announced sanctions on Abramovich with Chelsea allowed to operate under a special licence until 31 May,[185][186] while the Premier League disqualified Abramovich as a club director.[187] In the following weeks, reports emerged of Abramovich's involvement in brokering a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia and securing safe evacuation corridors in besieged Ukrainian cities.[188][189] An American government official revealed that the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy had requested the US government to not levy sanctions at Abramovich given his importance in war relief efforts.[190]

  Start of Boehly's consortium era and decline (2022–)[edit]  
  On 7 May 2022, Chelsea Football Club confirmed that terms have been agreed for a new ownership group, led by Todd Boehly, Clearlake Capital, Mark Walter and Hansjörg Wyss, to acquire the club.[1] On 25 May 2022, the British government approved the £4.25 billion Todd Boehly-led consortium takeover of Chelsea.[2] On 30 May 2022, the sale was completed, ending Abramovich's 19 year ownership of the club.[3]  
  The consortium led by Todd Boehly, chairman and CEO of Eldridge Industries, and Clearlake Capital, announced completion of the ownership transfer of Chelsea on the 30 May 2022.[4] The consortium included Hansjörg Wyss, founder of the Wyss Foundation, and Mark Walter, co-founder and CEO of Guggenheim Partners. Walter and Boehly are owners of the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Los Angeles Lakers, and the Los Angeles Sparks.[5] The transaction received all necessary approvals from the governments of the United Kingdom and Portugal, the Premier League, and other authorities that were mentioned by the club in their statement.[6]  
  The club then announced on the 20 June that Bruce Buck, who served as Chairman since 2003, would be stepping down from his role effective 30 June although he would continue to support the club as a Senior Advisor.[7] This was followed by the club then announcing the departure of long serving club director and de facto sporting director Marina Granovskaia on the 22 June 2022.[8]  
  In the 2022 summer transfer window, Chelsea spent more money in a transfer window than any other club in Premier League history.[9] The blues spent more than £250 million on players such as: Raheem Sterling, Marc Cucurella, Kalidou Koulibaly, Wesley Fofana and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.[10] Following a Champions League defeat to Dinamo Zagreb, Todd Boehly decided to sack Thomas Tuchel early in the 2022–23 season.[11] The BBC reported an uneasy relationship between Boehly and Tuchel regarding transfer decisions.[12] In September 2022, Chelsea decided to appoint Brighton & Hove Albion manager Graham Potter.[13] In the January transfer window, Chelsea broke the British transfer record by signing Enzo Fernández for £107 million.[14] By spending over £300 million in the January window, they became the first club in history to outspend all four major leagues combined.[15] Potter was later sacked in April 2023 with the club sitting at 11th place in the table.[16] Throughout the season, Chelsea scored a record-low 38 goals across the entire season and finished up in the bottom half for the first time since 1995–96.[17]  
  On 29 May 2023, it was announced that Mauricio Pochettino would take over managerial duties starting from 1 July 2023, replacing interim Frank Lampard who managed Chelsea since Potter's dismissal until the end of the 2022–23 season.[18]  
  History of Chelsea FC  
  A pride of London as the club's slogan indicates, Chelsea is one of the many clubs that the city of London has. Although the club is not yet the most successful club in the English capital, it is still the only one to have won the Champions League. A trophy obtained thanks to the pugnacity of its emblematic owner, Roman Abramovitch. Discover with us the historical Chelsea Football Club timeline.  
  Birth and debut in the elite of English football  
  The date 10 March 1905 is engraved in gold letters in the annals of Chelsea football club. This, for the simple reason that it refers to the time when the club was officially founded. But the history doesn't start there. It goes back to the mid 1904's when Gus Mears, the club's founder, bought the Stamford Bridge Athletics Stadium to build a football pitch.  
  He first approached a local Fulham football club to inform them about his intentions. However, when the club was reluctant, he decided to found his own football team for his new stadium. The name of the team had to best represent the district in which the stadium was located. As the Fulham club existed he opted for the borough of Chelsea for the naming. The Chelsea FC club was born a year later.  
  Chelsea FC entered the English football league a few months after its foundation in September 1905. Despite rather disappointing attendance figures, the new London club was soon to enter the English Premier League. Thus, in its second year of existence, the blues already had the opportunity to rub shoulders with the best teams in the kingdom. However, the team will have great difficulty with the elite of English football. With results on a rollercoaster ride, the club was relegated for the first time in 1910 before returning two years later. They remained there until 1915 when the English football championship was suspended due to the World War. Chelsea FC has reached the final of the FA Cup this year of 1915 and lost heavily against Sheffield United.  
  When Chelsea returned to the English pitch, they recorded best results. Indeed, the club finished third behind West Bromwich Albion in the 1920 championship. During the same period, Chelsea FC's appeal to the English public improved year by year. To achieve this, the club relied on great players such as goalkeeper Willie Foulke, forward George Hilsdon nicknamed "Gatling Gun" and striker Jimmy Windridge. Unfortunately the trophies did not follow.  
  A championship title then nothing at all  
  After Gus Mears, Ted Drake is certainly the second most prominent personality of the Chelsea football team. A former striker for another London football team, Ted decided in 1952 to pursue his career at Stamford Bridge. That year he became head coach of a team struggling to win trophies. From the moment he arrived, he didn't hesitate to point out the lack of application of the Chelsea players to prick them in their pride. He also decided to completely change the team's nickname.  
  For him, a blaze like "The Pensioners" does not allow a team to be taken seriously by its opponents. The former Arsenal striker will also apply this desire for change to the club's coat of arms. The representation of "The Pensioner" will be banned for good. The hurricane of change at Chelsea was thus underway and will extend to the club's recruitment policy. From now on, there will be no more question of buying popular players. Instead, Drake opted for players from lower divisions. For him, these players had more motivation to win trophies. This radical choice paid off in the first year of Ted Drake's management of the team. Chelsea FC finished eighth in the championship with a young team.  
  In 1955, Ted's new Chelsea reached the grail by winning the English championship under the nose of the great Wolverhampton team, who were defending champions. But the club's first title of history was no easy task. The most important moment of the season was the head-to-head with Wolves at Stamford Bridge, which ended in a goalless draw, enough to keep the blues comfortably ahead of their opponents.  
  The year 1955 was definitely the year of the blues and could have been better if Chelsea FC had been able to participate in the European Champion Clubs' Cup as winners of the English championship. Unfortunately, the English federation decided to not allow his team to participate. Chelsea was therefore forced to withdraw officially on 26 July 1955. The club will not see Europe until years later because the club will be unable to win another title in the years to come.  
  1960-1975, the cup’s period  
  The end of the 1950s will be marked by disillusionment for Ted Drake and his team. In addition to repeated national failures, the club would even end up losing Jimmy Greaves who was one of the best English players of the time. In the absence of the man who scored 132 goals in 169 games with the blues, Chelsea FC will eventually be relegated at the end of the 1961-1962 season. As a result, Ted Drake was dismissed to be replaced by Tommy Docherty.  
  Like Drake before him, Docherty decided to build a new team. Chelsea FC's new leaders in the 1960s were Peter Osgood, Ron Harris and Peter Bonetti. The new youthfulness of the team will very quickly help the club to climb back up in the elite of the English championship and to settle there durably. For nine successive years, the club finished each time in the top 7 of the best teams in the English championship. However, it would have great difficulty in establishing itself on the English throne.  
  During the 1964-1965 season, the club was very close to the throne with two games to spare. However, two defeats at Burnley and Liverpool would shatter the London club's dreams of glory. Fortunately, there will be no shortage of trophies to crown the efforts of the young Chelsea guard. The FA Cup, League Cup and Europe will be the hunting ground for the trophies.  
  The first trophy gleaned by the club during this period was the League Cup. It was won in the same 1964-65 season after a 3-2 win over Leicester, the first ever knockout cup final in the history of Chelsea FC. It was followed by two more knockout cup victories between 1965 and 1972, one in the FA Cup and another in the European Cup Winners' Cup. Both were achieved without coach Tommy Docherty, who was fired at the end of the 1966-1967 season. It was his replacement Dave Sexton who enabled the London club to win these trophies, well helped by English striker Peter Osgood, nicknamed "The King of Stamford Bridge".  
  Victory in the FA Cup was in 1970 and the European Cup Winners' Cup wining was in 1971 against the great Real Madrid. This period was also marked by the fervour of the blues fans who settled on a southern terrace later known as "The Shed". A name which today refers to one of the four stands at Stamford Bridge Stadium.  
  1975-1992: a time for loose  
  The 1980s remains to this day the darkest period in the history of Chelsea FC. Yet its beginnings were marked by an ambitious project that was supposed to place the club in another dimension. Unfortunately, the project would eventually put a strain on the club's finances, forcing the management to opt for the sale of the team's best players. A decision that will lead to the relegation of the club.  
  The buyout of the club will therefore be proposed to the businessman Ken Bates who was known for his interests with the football world. Bates bought the club in 1982 for a pound's worth of money which forced the businessman to pay off the club's debts. However, the stadium remains the property of various real estate companies. In his first year of management, Ken was on the verge of disaster. Indeed, during the 1982-1983 season, the club will have had all the difficulties in the world to maintain itself in the second division. A victory in the final moments and a draw at home in the last match will prevent the club from being relegated to the third division.  
  The following season will be the season of the big clean-up within the squad. Many of the players were asked to simply leave the club in order to make place for players adapted to the club's now modest budget. With Neal's clever recruitment, the club quickly moved up to the first division in 1984, finishing first in the second division championship. Neal, who the following year kept the club in the first division, had to give up his position due to illness.  
  His replacement, John Hollins, was unable to manage the team following the arrival of good players as reinforcements during the 1986 inter-season. Disagreements within the team forced the club to sell some of its players once again. Chelsea FC was once again relegated to Division Two in 1988. But this episode was quickly forgotten when Hollins was sacked and replaced by Bobby Campbell. The latter would allow the club to climb back into the elite the following year by finishing top of the second division championship once again.  
  A rebirth thanks to the Premier League  
  From the 1992-1993 season, the English football championship changed its name to become better known as the Premier League. While a club like Liverpool struggled to enter the new era of English football, Chelsea was able to return to success and put the dark years behind them once and for all.  
  The person who will best instil this winning mentality in the club was Ruud Gullit, who arrived in London in 1996 as a player-coach. Thanks to the recruitment of players such as Marcel Desailly, Frank Leboeuf and Gianfranco Zola, coach Ruud helped the club to win several trophies. However, 1996 did not remain in the memory of the blues fans as a good year. This was due to the tragic death in a helicopter of Matthew Harding. A legendary Chelsea fan who is regularly acclaimed during Chelsea’s games.  
  The first title of the Gullit era came in 1997 to end a famine that had lasted for 26 years. The 1997 FA Cup was the trophy that dusted off the club's trophy cabinet. Facing Middlesbrough, Chelsea opened the scoring quickly after 43 seconds of play thanks to Matteo Di Matteo. Another goal from Eddie Newton this time ensured a 2-0 win for the club.  
  During the 1997 inter-season, the club continued to strengthen with the arrival of players such as Gustave Poyet, André Flo, Graeme Le Saux, Ed de Goey and Célestine Babayaro. However, the next victories of the club will be achieved without coach Gullit who was replaced by Gianluca Vialli in the middle of the season. The new coach hardly had to settle down when his team was already celebrating two new trophies. The first was the Carling Cup, which was once again snatched from the poor Middlesbrough team on the same score of 2-0 with another goal from their executioner Di Matteo.  
  The second trophy won by Chelsea FC in 1998 was the European Cup Winners' Cup. On 13 May 1998 in Stockholm it took the entrance of the huge Gianfranco Zola for Chelsea to get rid of the Stuttgart team in the final by a narrow score of 1-0. This year will be a great year for the London club, which will qualify for the Champions League for the first time in its history after a third place in the championship.  
  The following year the club will once again beat Real Madrid but this time in the European Super Cup thanks to the only goal of Gustavo Poyet. However, a few months later the team will fail to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League because of a catastrophic return match in Spain against FC Barcelona. Vialli's players were unable to maintain the two-goal lead they had built up in England by falling 5-1.  
  Roman Abramovitch as president  
  The arrival of Roman will be the beginning of the big moves at Chelsea with the ultimate goal of winning the Champions League. A budget of nearly £100 million will be spent on recruiting the best players. Players such as Claude Makélélé, Juan Sebastian Veron, Damien Duff or Joe Cole will be recruited from the summer of 2003. Huge sums of money will also be invested to restructure the training centre and renovate the Cobham training centre.  
  Despite a rather successful first season with Ranieri, the Russian billionaire will decide to disembark Claudio Ranieri to hire the young José Mourinho as head coach. For Roman, José Mourinho was the only coach capable to bring his team to the top of England and Europe. The first part of the contract will be correctly completed. Between 2005 and 2008, José will make the club win its first elite championship in fifty years. Better still, it will allow the club to make the first back-to-back in its history before winning several national cups.  
  However, José Mourinho's Chelsea will never make it to the Champions League final because of their successive defeats against Raphaël Benitez's Liverpool. After a painful separation between José Mourinho and Chelsea in 2008, the club will pass Liverpool for the first time in history of Champions league to reach the final. That year it was another English club, Manchester United, who put an end to Roman's dreams by beating his club on penalties after a hard-fought final.  
  Neither Avraham Grant nor Guus Hiddink will be able to satisfy the Chelsea boss in his quest for the European grail. Carlo Ancelotti's record double league and cup double in 2010 is hardly enough to appease the Russian billionaire's hunger. Despite an exceptional attacking game, Ancelotti will be replaced by André Villas-Boas who ends up making his players unhappy because of some questionable choices.  
  It is in the middle of the 2011-2012 season that the second Portuguese to have coached the Chelsea team will be fired. Di Matteo as a simple interim coach will achieve the feat of offering the club the only Champions League in its history thanks to a route that will lead the club to beat Bayern Munich on penalties at the Allianz Arena.  
  This final victory marked the end of an era at the club. The main architects of the epic will leave one by one to make way for new players and coaches. Rafael Benitez, the club's former nemesis, will enable the club to win a UEFA Europa League title in 2013. The return of José Mourinhoen 2013 will allow the club to win a Premier League and a League Cup in 2015. Italian coach Antonio Conte will in turn glean a league and FA Cup between 2016 and 2018 before leaving the place to Mauricio Sarri. The latter remains the last Chelsea coach to bring a trophy back to Stamford Bridge. These include the Europa League trophy snatched from Arsenal in Baku in 2019.

  The history of Futbol Club Barcelona begins from the football club's founding in 1899 up until the present day. FC Barcelona, also known simply as Barcelona and familiarly as Barça, is based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The club was founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper. The club played amateur football until 1910 in various regional competitions. In 1910, the club participated in their first of many European competitions, and has since amassed fourteen UEFA trophies and a sextuple. In 1928, Barcelona co-founded La Liga, the top-tier in Spanish football, along with a string of other clubs. As of 2023, Barcelona has never been relegated from La Liga, a record they share with Athletic Bilbao and arch-rival Real Madrid.  
  The history of Barcelona has often been political. Though it was a club created and run by foreigners, Barcelona gradually became a club associated with Catalan values. In Spain's transition to autocracy in 1925, Catalonia became increasingly hostile towards the central government in Madrid. The hostility enhanced Barcelona's image as a focal point for Catalonism, and when Francisco Franco banned the use of the Catalan language, the stadium of Barcelona became one of the few places the people could express their dissatisfaction. The Spanish transition to democracy in 1978 has not dampened the club's image of Catalan pride. In the 2000s and 2010s – a period of sporting success in the club and an increased focus on Catalan players – club officials have been openly faithful to historic club commitment to the defense of the country, democracy, freedom of expression and the right to decide, and have condemns any action that may impede the full exercise of these rights.[1]  
  Beginnings of Football Club Barcelona (1899–1922)[edit]  
  On 22 October 1899, Joan Gamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November 1899. Eleven players attended: Walter Wild (the first director of the club), Luis de Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons. As a result, Football Club Barcelona was born.[2][3] The blue and red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900. The prevailing Catalonia theory, endorsed by the club, is that the colours were taken from the rugby team of Merchant Taylors' Boys' School, Crosby. The school was attended by brothers Arthur Witty and Ernest Witty, two Anglo-Spanish players heavily involved in Barça's formative years.[4][5]  
  In 1906, Juli Marial became the 6th President of FC Barcelona and had to steer the club through difficult times in both social and sporting terms, as the club lost a third of its members during his presidency, as well as a large part of its more veteran players who had retired, most of which being the founding members such as Gamper, Witty, Ossó and Parsons, who had been the pillars of the team since its foundation. However, his period in charge of the club also coincided with a major restructuring of the team,[8] and during his tenure, several footballers arrived at the club who would later form the first great team of Barcelona, such as Paco Bru, Charles Wallace and Enrique Peris from FC Internacional in 1906, and the Massana brothers (Santiago and Alfredo), José Irízar and José Berdié from X Sporting Club in 1908. When Marial left, the club was in decline, and it looked like its days were numbered.[8]  
  In 1908, Joan Gamper took over the presidency because the club was on the verge of bankruptcy, in part because the club had not won anything since the Campeonato de Cataluña in 1905, thus causing their financial trouble. One of his main achievements was to help Barcelona acquire its own stadium and thus achieve a stable income.[9]  
  On 14 March 1909, the team moved into the Camp de la Indústria, a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings, a logo contest was held the following year. Carles Comamala won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears as of 2022[update], with some minor changes.[10]  
  The stadium is regarded as the main element that helped the club grow in the 1910s and become a dominant team,[11] winning three successive Campionats de Catalunya between 1909 and 1911, three Copa del del Rey in four years between 1910 and 1913, and four successive Pyrenees Cup between the inaugural year in 1910 and 1913, which was one of the earliest international club cups in Europe since it consisted of the best teams of Languedoc, Midi and Aquitaine (Southern France), the Basque Country and Catalonia; all were former members of the Marca Hispanica region.[12] The contest was the most prestigious in that era.[13] As well as the aforementioned players acquired in the Marial presidency, Barça's first great team also had the likes of Amechazurra, Romà Forns, Pepe Rodríguez, Carles Comamala, and Jack Greenwell. The latter became the club's first full-time coach in 1917.[14]  
  During the same period, the club changed its official language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity.[15] On 4 February 1917, the club held its first testimonial match to honour Ramón Torralba who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa, which Barcelona won 6–2.[16]  
  Gamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club-members, and, by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new Les Cortes, which they inaugurated the same year.[17] Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 22,000, and was later[when?] expanded to 60,000.[18]  
  Gamper recruited Jack Greenwell as the first full-time manager in Barcelona's history. After he was hired, the club's fortunes began to improve on the field. During the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven Campeonato de Cataluña, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups and enjoyed its first "golden age".[7][9]  
  On 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club.[19] This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club.[17] On 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alcántara, against the Spain national team. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his airplane.[20] In 1928, victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled "Oda a Platko", which was written by a member of the Generation of '27, Rafael Alberti, inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper, Franz Platko.[21] Two years after the victory, on 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.[9]  
  Although they continued to have players of the standing of Josep Escolà, the club now entered a period of decline, in which political conflict overshadowed sports throughout society. Attendance at matches dropped as the citizens of Barcelona were occupied with discussing political matters.[22] Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936 and 1938,[7] success at a national level (with the exception of the 1937 disputed title) evaded them.  
  A month after the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao.[23] On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party.[24] He was dubbed the martyr of barcelonisme, and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity.[25] In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic.[26] The tour led to the financial security of the club, but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.[27][28][26]  
  On 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the Italian Air Force, causing more than 3,000 deaths, with one of the bombs hitting the club's offices.[29][30] A few months later, Catalonia came under occupation and as a symbol of the "undisciplined" Catalanism, the club, now down to just 3,486 members, and faced a number of restrictions. All signs of regional nationalism, including language, flag and other signs of separatism were banned throughout Spain. The Catalan flag was banned and the club were prohibited from using non-Spanish names. These measures forced the club to change its name to Club de Fútbol Barcelona and to remove the Catalan flag from its crest.[31]  
  In 1943, Barcelona faced rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals of Copa del Generalísimo. The first match at Les Corts was won by Barcelona 3–0. Before the second leg, Franco's director of state security visited Barcelona's players in the changing room. He reminded them that they were only playing due to the "generosity of the regime". Real Madrid comfortably won the match, beating Barcelona 11–1.[32]  
  Despite the difficult political situation, CF Barcelona enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with Josep Samitier as coach and players like César, Ramallets and Velasco, they won La Liga for the first time since 1929. They added two more titles in 1948 and 1949.[33] In 1949, they also won the first Copa Latina.[34] In June 1950, Barcelona signed Ladislao Kubala, who was to be an important figure at the club.[35]  
  On a rainy Sunday of 1951, the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and surprising the Francoist authorities. The reason was simple: at the same time, a tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, receiving the support of blaugrana fans. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent much more than just Catalonia and many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.[36][37]  
  Coach Fernando Daučík and player László Kubala, regarded by many as the club's best, inspired the team to several trophies in 1952, including La Liga, the Copa del Generalísimo, the Copa Latina, the Copa Eva Duarte and the Copa Martini Rossi. In 1953, they helped the club win La Liga and the Copa del Generalísimo again.[18]  
  The 1960s were less successful for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The completion of the Camp Nou, finished in 1957, meant the club had little money to spend on new players.[40] The 1960s saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fusté and Carles Rexach, and the club won the Copa del Generalísimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona restored some pride by beating Real Madrid 1–0 in the 1968 Copa del Generalísimo final at the Santiago Bernabéu – in front of Francisco Franco – with their coach Salvador Artigas, a former republican pilot in the civil war. With the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1975, the club changed its official name back to Futbol Club Barcelona and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters once again.[41][42]  
  The 1973–74 season saw the arrival of a new player in Johan Cruyff, who was bought for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[43] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son Jordi, after the local Catalan Saint George.[44] Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973–74 season for the first time since 1960,[7] defeating Real Madrid 5–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu along the way. He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time (the first player to do so) in 1974, while he was still with Barcelona.[45]  
  Núñez and the stabilization years (1978–2000)[edit]  
  In 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1975 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such world-class players as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.[46][47]  
  On 16 May 1979, the club won its first UEFA Cup Winners' Cup by beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 4–3 in Basel in a final watched by more than 30,000 travelling blaugrana fans. The same year, Núñez began to invest in the club's youth program by converting La Masia to a dormitory for young academy players from abroad. The name of the dormitory would later become synonymous with the youth program of Barcelona.[48]  
  In June 1982, Diego Maradona was signed for a world record fee of £5 million from Boca Juniors.[49] In the following season, under coach César Luis Menotti, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. Maradona's time with Barcelona, however, was short-lived and he soon left for Napoli. At the start of the 1984–85 season, Terry Venables was hired as manager and he won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder Bernd Schuster. The next season, he took the team to their second European Cup final, only to lose on penalties to Steaua București after a 0–0 draw in Seville.[46]  
  Around this time, tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president Núñez's dictatorial rule and the nationalist support group, Boixos Nois. The group, identified with left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Núñez's presidency.[50] Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.[51]  
  After the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Barcelona signed the English top-scorer Gary Lineker, along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, but the team could not achieve success, as Schuster was excluded from the team. Terry Venables was subsequently fired at the beginning of the 1987–88 season and replaced with Luis Aragonés. The season finished with the players rebelling against president Núñez, in an event known as the Hesperia Mutiny (El motí de l'Hespèria/El motín del Hesperia), and a 1–0 victory at the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad.[46]  
  It was ten years after the inception of the youth program, La Masia, when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team. One of the first graduates who would later earn international acclaim was Pep Guardiola.[54] Under Cruyff's guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley Stadium, with a free-kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de España. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the then club's most successful manager. He also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years.[55] Cruyff's fortune was to change, however, and in his final two seasons, after he failed to win any trophies, he fell out with president Núñez, resulting in his departure.[46]  
  Reacting to Cruyff's departure, an independent protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, Joan Laporta and Alfons Godall. The objective of the group, called L'Elefant Blau was to oppose the presidency of Núñez, which they regarded as a corruption of the club's traditional values.[56][57] Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003.  
  Cruyff was briefly replaced by Bobby Robson, who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996–97. He recruited Ronaldo from his previous club, PSV and delivered a cup treble, winning the Copa del Rey, UEFA Cup Winners Cup and the Supercopa de España. Despite his success, Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for Louis van Gaal to become available.[58]  
  Like Maradona, Ronaldo only stayed a short time before he left for Internazionale. New stars emerged, however, such as Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert, Luis Enrique and Rivaldo, and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its centenari, winning the Primera División title and where Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this domestic success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and Núñez resigning in 2000.[58]  
  The departures of Núñez and Louis van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou with Madrid, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd.[59] The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Llorenç Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season.  
  Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.[60]  
  In the 2005–06 season, Barcelona repeated their Liga and Supercupa successes. The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in a 3–0 win over Real Madrid. It was Rijkaard's second victory at the Bernabéu, making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice. Ronaldinho's performance was so impressive that after his second goal, which was Barcelona's third, some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation.[67] In the Champions League, Barcelona beat Arsenal 2–1 in the final. Trailing 1–0 to a ten-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining, they came back to win 2–1, with substitute Henrik Larsson, in his final appearance for the club, setting up goals for Samuel Eto'o and fellow substitute Juliano Belletti, for the club's first European Cup victory in 14 years.[68]  
  Despite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 2006–07 season without any trophies won. A pre-season United States tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Samuel Eto'o and rising star Lionel Messi. There was open feuding as Eto'o publicly criticized coach Rijkaard and Ronaldinho.[69] Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form.[70] In La Liga, Barcelona were in first place for much of the season, but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions. Barcelona advanced to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, winning the first leg against Getafe 5–2, with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to Diego Maradona's goal of the century, but then lost the second leg 4–0. They took part in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup, but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side Internacional.[71] In the Champions League, Barcelona were knocked out of the competition in the last 16 by eventual runners-up Liverpool on the away goals rule.  
  Barcelona finished the 2007–08 season third in La Liga and reached the semi-finals of the Champions League and Copa del Rey, both times losing to the eventual champions, Manchester United and Valencia, respectively. The day after a 4–1 defeat to Real Madrid, Joan Laporta announced that Barcelona B coach Pep Guardiola would take over Rijkaard's duties on 30 June 2008.[72]  
  In the pre-season of 2008–09, a motion of no confidence was raised against club president Joan Laporta. This motion received 60 percent support, just short of the 66 percent required to oust him, prompting eight of the directors to resign. Continuing as president, Laporta made large changes to the playing staff, spending nearly €90 million rebuilding the squad.[73][74]  
  For the second time that season, Barcelona played Real Madrid in El Clásico, this time at the Santiago Bernabéu. Barcelona won the historic match 2–6, which was the largest margin of victory by which Barcelona had won in Madrid since the 1970s, when Johan Cruyff led Barcelona to win 0–5.[75] On 6 May 2009, Barcelona played against Chelsea in the second leg of the Champions League semi-finals. Following a goalless first leg, Chelsea led the second leg at Stamford Bridge 1–0, from the eighth minute until injury time, when Andrés Iniesta scored an equaliser in the 93rd minute from the edge of the penalty area, sending Barcelona through to the final on the away goals rule.[76] On 13 May, Barcelona beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 to win the Copa del Rey for a record 25th time.[77] Three days later, Real Madrid lost a league match and Barcelona was crowned La Liga champions for the 2008–09 season.[78]  
  With a largely homegrown squad, in which seven players of the starting 11 were products of their youth academy, La Masia, Barcelona defeated the defending champions Manchester United 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome on 27 May 2009, to earn their third Champions League title. This completed the first ever treble won by a Spanish side, having already won the La Liga and Copa del Rey in that season.[79][80][81]  
  Barcelona went on to win the 2009 Supercopa de España against Athletic Bilbao,[82] and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk,[83] becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble. In December 2009, Barcelona won the 2009 Club World Cup,[84] thus becoming the first team ever to accomplish the sextuple.[85] In May 2010, Barcelona won La Liga for the second consecutive time with a record Spanish league tally of 99 points out of 114 possible.[86]  
  On 13 June, Rosell was elected president of Barcelona with more than 60% of the vote of club members. Barcelona begin start off the season with the traditional curtain raiser, the Supercopa de España, against Sevilla, losing the first leg 3–1 at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium. In the return leg at the Camp Nou, however, the team would win 4–0, thus claiming the Supercopa 5–3 on aggregate. In the 2010–11 season, Barcelona would endure a slow start to the campaign, despite a victory over Racing de Santander (3–0) on the opening day of the season; they would go on to be defeated 2–0 at the Camp Nou by newly promoted minnows Hércules. Nevertheless, Barça would recover and go on to magnificent 5–0 win over Real Madrid at home. In the Champions League semi-finals against Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu, Lionel Messi scored two goals to ensure a 0–2 win for Barcelona, with the second leg at home ending in a 1–1 draw, sending Barça through to the Final to take on Manchester United. In the Copa del Rey Final at the Mestalla Stadium against Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo would convert a header on the 100th minute to win the Copa for Madrid, 1–0. Barça, however, would end up beating Manchester United 3–1 with goals from Pedro, Messi and David Villa to win them the Champions League for the fourth time in club history. Barcelona would also claim La Liga with 96 points to Real Madrid's 92 for the third time in a row to round off a very successful season.  
  The 2011–12 season would kick off with the Supercopa de España, this time against reigning Copa del Rey champions Real Madrid. In Madrid, Barcelona would play to a 2–2 draw, but would seal the Supercup with a 3–2 win at the Camp Nou. The first kick of a ball in La Liga for Barça would be at the Camp Nou against Villarreal, with the Catalans easily winning 5–0. In the first Liga Clásico of the season, Barcelona would win 1–3 in Madrid to level on points with Madrid heading into the Christmas break. Nevertheless, Barcelona would drop two points away to Espanyol, which ended 1–1, to go two points behind their archrivals Madrid. In the Copa del Rey semi-finals, in the first leg against Real Madrid, the Blaugrana would win 1–2 in Madrid, later sealing their place in the semi-finals after a 2–2 draw at the Camp Nou. In the Round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League, the then-defending champions would defeat Bayer Leverkusen 1–3 in Germany and rout them 7–1 at the Camp Nou. The quarter-finals against Milan would begin slowly for the Catalan club, playing to a 0–0 draw in Milan, only to sweep the Italian club aside 3–1 at the Camp Nou with two strikes from Lionel Messi. In the semi-finals against Chelsea, Barcelona would be defeated 1–0 in London after a Didier Drogba strike in the 45th minute. The second leg, meanwhile, at the Nou Camp finished 2–2, thus eliminating Barcelona from European contention. In the penultimate game of the season at home to Real Madrid, perhaps the most important game of the Catalan club's season, Barça would collapse 1–2 to Real Madrid with a strike each from Sami Khedira and Cristiano Ronaldo, winning Los Blancos the match. On 27 April, coach Pep Guardiola announced in a tearful press conference in Barcelona that he would be stepping down as coach of the Catalan club at the end of the season, citing that he needed a break from football; he was to be replaced by Tito Vilanova. In Barcelona's final game of the season, the Copa del Rey finals against Athletic Bilbao, Barça would win 3–0 with a brace from Pedro and a strike from Messi, winning the club the trophy. That season, Barça also won the 2011 UEFA Super Cup, 2–0 against Porto and the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup, 4–0 against Santos.  
  Barça's 2012–13 season yet again began with a Supercopa contention, this time another incarnation of El Clásico. Barcelona would win the first leg at home 3–2 with goals from Messi, Pedro and Xavi, but in the second leg, despite a wonderfully-struck free kick from Messi from 35 yards out, Barcelona would succumb 2–1 to their fiercest foes with goals from Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higuaín. In La Liga, Barcelona would shoot straight up to the top of the league table with a 5–1 win over Real Sociedad. In the most-hyped game of the season so far, Barcelona and Real Madrid would play out what many regard as the best Clásico in recent memory, ending in a 2–2 draw at the Camp Nou with both Messi and Ronaldo netting twice for their respective clubs. Barça would also kick off their Copa del Rey defence with a 3–0 win over Alavés. In the Champions League on 7 November 2012, Barcelona would fall 2–1 to Celtic, with Messi grabbing his third Champions League goal of the 2012–13 season in the 90th minute in Glasgow. Barcelona were eliminated from Europe 0–7 on aggregate in the semi-finals against eventual champions Bayern Munich, the worst-ever aggregate loss in any European competition for the club.[87]  
  On 22 July 2013, Gerardo Martino was confirmed as manager of Barcelona for the 2013–14 season.[88] Barcelona's first official games under Martino were the home and away legs of the 2013 Supercopa de España, which Barça won 1–1 on away goals.  
  On 23 January 2014, Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the admissibility of the complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of Neymar. Josep Maria Bartomeu replaced him to finish the term in 2016.  
  In April 2014, FIFA banned the club from buying players for the next two transfer windows following the violation of the FIFA's rules about the transfer of footballers aged under 18.[89] A statement on FIFA's website read, "With regard to the case in question, FC Barcelona has been found to be in breach of art. 19 of the Regulations in the case of ten minor players and to have committed several other concurrent infringements in the context of other players, including under Annexe 2 of the Regulations. The Disciplinary Committee regarded the infringements as serious and decided to sanction the club with a transfer ban at both national and international level for two complete and consecutive transfer periods, together with a fine of CHF 450,000. Additionally, the club was granted a period of 90 days in which to regularise the situation of all minor players concerned."[90] FIFA rejected an appeal in August but the pending appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) allowed Barcelona to sign players during the summer of 2014.[91]  
  On 17 May, they played their final game of the season against Atlético Madrid at the Camp Nou, needing a win in order to win the La Liga championship, while Atletico needed at least a draw in order to win their first league title since the 1995–96 season and their 10th overall. Barcelona were leading 1–0 at the 33rd minute after Alexis Sánchez opened the scoreline, however Diego Godín headed an equaliser for Altetico in the 49th minute, drawing the game 1–1, and giving Atletico Madrid their 10th La Liga title.[92]  
  In late December 2014, Barcelona's appeal to the CAS was unsuccessful and the original transfer ban was reinstated, leaving the club unable to utilise the 2015 winter and summer transfer windows.[91] On 5 January 2015, Zubizareta was sacked by the board after 4 years as director of football.[100] On 12 February 2015, Barcelona announced the formation of a new Football Area Technical Commission, made up of vice-president Jordi Mestre, board member Javier Bordas, Carles Rexach and Ariedo Braida.[101]  
  Barcelona won the treble in the 2014–15 season, winning La Liga, Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League, and became the first European team to have won the treble twice.[102] On 17 May, the club clinched their 23rd La Liga title after defeating Atlético Madrid.[103] This was Barcelona's seventh La Liga title in the last ten years.[104] On 30 May, the club defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final at Camp Nou.[105] On 6 June, Barcelona won the Champions League final with a 3–1 win against Juventus, which completed the treble, the club's second in six years.[106]  
  Despite the departures of Pedro and Xavi, each of whom went to English club, Chelsea, and Qatari side, Al Sadd, respectively, Barcelona were able to defend their league title, with a 3–0 win over Granada at the final day of season. Uruguayan striker, Luis Suárez, scored all 3 goals of the match, as the win put them one point above their El Clásico rivals, securing the title.[111] Barcelona also won the 2015–16 Copa del Rey with a 2–0 win against Sevilla in the final.[112] Barcelona also won the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup, with a 3–0 win against Argentine club, River Plate, in the final.[113]  
  In the UEFA Champions League, Barcelona finished at the top of their group stage, without losing once.[114] During the knockout rounds, Barcelona started with a 5–1 aggregate win over English side, Arsenal in the Round of 16.[115] During the quarter-finals, however, they were knocked out by Atlético Madrid, after a 0–2 loss at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, making them lose 2–3 on aggregate.[116]  
  Barcelona were able to win the 2016–17 Copa del Rey, after they defeated Deportivo Alavés 3–1 in the final.[124] They weren't able to defend their league, however, as they finished 3 points behind Real Madrid.[125] Their last loss during that league season was a 0–2 away defeat to Málaga.[126]  
  Barcelona's campaign in Europe was a different story. Their first game in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League was a 7–0 thrashing of Celtic in the group stage; three of those goals came from Lionel Messi.[127] Barcelona finished at the top of the group with 15 points, and their only loss in the group stage was a 1–3 loss to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium.[128] In the round of 16, Barcelona was drawn against French club, Paris-Saint Germain. In the first leg, they shocking lost 4–0 at the Parc des Princes in France.[129] More shocking, in the second leg, Barcelona won 6–1 against the French outfit, meaning the Catalan club won 6–5 on aggregate and progressed to the quarterfinals.[130][131] The match was dubbed by the Spanish media and FC Barcelona fans as "La Remontada" (Spanish for "The Comeback").[132] Despite this, Barcelona were knocked out in the quarter-finals by Juventus, losing 0–3 on aggregate following a 0–0 draw at the Camp Nou.[133]  
  On 1 March 2017, Luis Enrique announced that he would be leaving Barcelona at the end of that season following their 6–1 win against Sporting Gijón.[134] On 29 May 2017, FC Barcelona announced that Ernesto Valverde would be the new manager of the club.[135] Luis Enrique wasn't the only significant person to leave Barcelona during the summer of 2017. Brazilian star, Neymar, who scored 2 goals against Paris Saint-Germain during their 6–1 "remontada", left for the French side for a world record €222 million fee.[136] As a replacement, Barcelona signed French striker, Ousmane Dembélé from Borussia Dortmund for €105 million.[137] During the 2017–18 winter transfer window, Barcelona signed Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool,[138] and sold Javier Mascherano to Chinese Super League outfit, Hebei China Fortune.[139]  
  The 2017–18 was Andrés Iniesta's last season at FC Barcelona, as he decided to leave the club for J.League side Vissel Kobe.[145] As a replacement, Barcelona signed Chilean midfielder, Arturo Vidal from Bayern Munich.[146]  
  Barcelona won their first game of the 2018–19 season, the 2018 Supercopa de España against Sevilla, at the Stade Ibn Batouta in Morocco.[147] It was the first Supercopa de España to be held outside of Spain.[148] Barcelona also secured their 26th La Liga title during the 2018–19 season, following a 1–0 win against Levante at the Camp Nou, with three games remaining in the season.[149] However, they were knocked out of the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League in the semi-finals by Liverpool. For the second consecutive years, Barcelona was eliminated with a 3-goal first-leg lead. They won the first leg 3–0 at the Camp Nou,[150] however, Liverpool won 4–0 during the second leg at Anfield,[151] meaning that Liverpool won 4–3 on aggregate, and progressed to the final, which they won.[152] Barcelona also lost the 2019 Copa del Rey Final, with a 1–2 loss to Valencia at the Estadio Benito Villamarín in Seville.[153]  
  On 13 January 2020, following the loss to Atlético Madrid in the Spanish Supercup, former Real Betis coach Quique Setién replaced Ernesto Valverde as the new head coach of Barcelona.[154] Barcelona were leading the league when the COVID-19 pandemic halted the competition, but their performance fell off and ultimately lost the league title to Real Madrid on 16 July, with just one game to spare.[155]  
  In the Champions League, Barcelona suffered one of their worst defeats in history, losing 2–8 against Bayern Munich in the one-legged quarter-final tie.[156] Barcelona finished the season trophyless for first time in 12 years.  
  The return of Laporta and post Messi era (2021–present)[edit]  
  On 17 August, the club confirmed that Setién had been removed from his position as manager,[157] with director of football Eric Abidal also dismissed from his position.[158] Two days later, Ronald Koeman was appointed as the new head coach of Barcelona.[159]  
  Rising dissatisfaction among supporters due to worsening finances and decline on the pitch in the previous seasons led to Josep Maria Bartomeu announcing his resignation as president on 27 October 2020 to avoid facing a vote of no confidence from the club members.[160][161]  
  On 7 March 2021, Joan Laporta was elected president of Barcelona with 54.28% of the vote.[162] In the Champions League, Barcelona were knocked out by Paris Saint-Germain in the round of 16, breaking the streak of 13 successive appearances in the quarter-finals.[163] Barcelona won a record-extending 31st Copa del Rey, their only trophy under Koeman, after defeating Athletic Bilbao 4–0 in the final.[164] Barcelona finished the 2020–21 season third in La Liga, their lowest league position since 2007–08 season.[165]  
  In August 2021 Barcelona found themselves unable to comply with La Liga's Financial Fair Play requirements, and revealed a club debt of €1.35bn and a wage bill accounting for 103% of total income. Negotiations with Lionel Messi, now in the final year of his contract, had been ongoing for some time. However on 5 August 2021, Barcelona announced that they would be unable to re-sign Messi to an extension due to La Liga regulations. This was despite the fact that the club and Messi had reached an agreement over the details of a new contract. Messi departed the club after 21 years as a Barça player, and the club's all-time leading goalscorer, and signed on a free transfer with French champions Paris Saint-Germain.[166][167] The financial implications also restricted Barcelona in the transfer market and as a result most of the incoming players were either free transfers or loans and they had to reduce players' wages to register the incoming players.[168]  
  Poor performances in La Liga and the Champions League led to the sacking of Ronald Koeman on 28 October, with a club legend Xavi replacing him.[169][170] Xavi could not reverse the fortunes in the Champions League, and Barcelona dropped down to the Europa League for the first time since 2003–04, subsequently exiting in the quarter-finals.[171] In the domestic league, Xavi massively improved Barça's form and guided them from ninth to second, guaranteeing a Champions League spot next season. However, this also meant Barcelona finished trophyless after earlier Supercopa and Copa del Rey exits.[172]  
  On 1 July 2022, the stadium was officially renamed as "Spotify Camp Nou". It was the first time in club history to reach a deal with a partner who acquires the naming rights to the stadium.[173]  
  On 15 January 2023, Xavi guided Barcelona to their first trophy since the 2021 Copa del Rey, as the Catalans defeated Real Madrid 3–1 in the Supercopa de España final.[174]

  History of Liverpool F.C.  
  The history of Liverpool Football Club is divided into three periods:  
  History of Liverpool F.C. (1892–1959) – The club was founded in 1892 following a split from Everton F.C. and joined the Football League in 1893. The appointment of Tom Watson as manager resulted in the club's first successful period, in which they won two League Championships. Two League Championships were won in the 1920s and a further one was won in 1947. Following the club's fortunes declined and they were relegated to the Second Division in 1954.[1]  
  History of Liverpool F.C. (1959–1985) – Bill Shankly was appointed as manager in 1959 and guided the club back into the First Division. Shankly's arrival laid the foundations for the club's success in the 1970s and 80s domestically and in European competition, as the club won numerous League Championships and four European Cups.  
  History of Liverpool F.C. (1985–present) – Following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, English clubs were banned from European competitions until 1991. The club was still successful domestically winning three League Championships during this period. The 1990s saw a lack of success for the club as they struggled to repeat their success in the Premier League era. The club reached former heights in 2005 when they won the UEFA Champions League (formerly known as the European Cup) for a fifth time.

  History of Rangers F.C.  
  Rangers Football Club, formed in 1872, is the fourth-oldest association football club in Scotland, and the first club in the world to win more than fifty national league titles (55 as of the end of the 2020–21 season). It is the second-most successful club in world football in terms of trophies won, behind Egyptian club Al Ahly.[1]  
  The team's first game was a goalless draw against Callander on Glasgow Green's Flesher's Haugh in May 1872. Moses McNeil suggested the name Rangers after seeing the name "Swindon Rangers" in a book about English rugby.[3] Rangers played two matches in their birth year; their second, with the team wearing light-blue shirts, was a comprehensive 11–0 win over a team named Clyde (not the present Clyde).  
  Rangers began to grow into a more formal football club, and in 1876 their first player was called up to play international football. Moses McNeil made his Scotland debut against Wales. In 1883, the Glasgow Football Association was formed, with Rangers one of its six founder members.[5]  
  In 1888, the Old Firm fixture was born when Rangers met Celtic for the first time in a friendly match. Celtic won 5–2.  
  The 1890–91 season saw the inception of the Scottish Football League, and Rangers were one of its ten original members. By this time, Rangers were playing at the first Ibrox Stadium. Their first-ever league match took place on 16 August 1890 and resulted in a 5–2 victory over Edinburgh club Heart of Midlothian. After finishing joint-top with Dumbarton, a play-off was held at Cathkin Park to decide the championship. The match finished 2–2, and the title was shared for the only time in its history. It was the first of Rangers' world-record 55 championships.[6]  
  Rangers lost their first two Scottish Cup Finals, to Vale of Leven in 1877 and 1879, but lifted the trophy in 1894 for the first time after a 3–1 win over Celtic. Rangers even came close to winning the English FA Cup in 1887, when they lost to Aston Villa in the semi-final.  
  Rangers enjoyed further Scottish Cup wins in 1897 and 1898.  
  Rangers formally became a limited company on 27 May 1899, and their match secretary William Wilton was appointed as the club's first manager. Today's Ibrox Stadium (known then as Ibrox Park) was constructed the same year. The club also appointed its first board of directors under the chairmanship of James Henderson.  
  Rangers were in the ascendancy at the turn of the century, winning the championship seven times between 1900 and 1918 (including four in a row). The 1898–99 season saw the Gers win all eighteen league games to establish a perfect record. This feat has yet to be repeated by the club, although the team did go through the 2013–14 and 2020–21 seasons unbeaten.  
  Between 1902 and 1910, Celtic became the dominant force, and though Rangers had the chance to foil a third league and cup double in 1909, the Scottish FA withheld the cup due to a pitch invasion by supporters. Both clubs were ordered to compensate hosts Queen's Park for the damage caused by the fans.  
  Having lost the title in 1919, Rangers responded in 1920 with one of the best seasons in their history as Wilton and his right-hand man Bill Struth retained the title, with the club scoring 106 goals in 42 league games.  
  Wilton died in a boating accident in May 1920, and Bill Struth was appointed manager.  
  The key statistic of the 1930s was three consecutive Scottish Cup wins between 1934 and 1936. Rangers then lost in the first round of the 1937 competition to Queen of the South. This was the first Rangers game ever to be captured on film.  
  The post-war seasons saw Rangers dominate, but not before a boardroom coup in the summer of 1947. The board of Rangers had previously been an amateur body made up of former players, but when chairman James Bowie suggested a 71-year-old Struth retire in order to allow a younger man to take charge, a revolution occurred. Bowie was forced out the chair and was said never to have set foot in Ibrox ever again, such was his disdain for the circumstances of his departure.  
  Struth went on to steer Rangers to eighteen league championships, ten Scottish Cups and two League Cups in his 34-year tenure as manager. He was also the first manager in the history of Scottish football to win the domestic treble, in season 1948–49. The success was based on the so-called Iron Curtain defence, which remained virtually unchanged from 1946 to 1953.[7]  
  Under Struth's reign, Rangers managed to set a new record of becoming the first club in Britain and second club in Europe (after MTK Budapest) to win nine consecutive league championships (from the 1938–39 to 1946–47 seasons), although the middle seven were wartime competitions considered to be unofficial.[8]  
  After Bill Struth collected two more domestic doubles, in 1950 and 1953, Scot Symon was appointed as Rangers' third manager on 15 June 1954.  
  Symon continued Struth's success by winning six league championships, five Scottish Cups and four League Cups. He also became the second manager to win the domestic treble, in season 1963–64. Another purple patch began at the end of the 1950s: from 1957 until 1965, Rangers achieved four league titles, plus an equal number of wins in both the League and Scottish Cups. Jim Baxter was a notable Rangers player during this period.  
  Baxter departed for England in 1965, but the void he left was filled by John Greig, and although Rangers finished the decade in the shadow of their European Cup-winning neighbours, the foundations were being laid for future success.  
  In the 1956–57 season, Symon took Rangers into the European Cup for the first time, but it ended quickly when they were knocked out by Nice. The following season saw Rangers suffer their worst-ever defeat by their arch rivals, with Celtic beating them 7–1 in the 1957 League Cup Final.  
  Rangers reached the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1960, losing to Eintracht Frankfurt by a record aggregate for a Scottish team of 12–4. In 1961, Rangers became the first British team to reach a European final when they contested the Cup Winners' Cup Final against Fiorentina. They lost 4–1 on aggregate. Rangers reached the final again in 1967, losing 1–0 after extra time to Bayern Munich.  
  Following the death of incumbent chairman John Wilson in 1963, Rangers appointed John Lawrence as his successor. Lawrence had been on the board of Rangers since the mid-1950s and remained in charge for a decade before he resigned to become honorary president.[9] During his tenure as chairman, Lawrence oversaw two of the most pivotal events in the club's history, namely the 1971 Ibrox disaster and the 1972 European Cup Winners' Cup Final. His legacy continued in the shape of his grandson Lawrence Marlborough, who inherited his shareholding and was appointed vice-chairman in 1979. Marlborough went on to revitalise the fortunes of the club in the 1980s, before selling his stake in the club's parent company to David Murray in 1988.[10]  
  Symon paid the penalty of Celtic's comparative success in Scotland and Europe in October 1967, giving way to his former assistant Davie White after rejecting a move to make him general manager with White in charge of team affairs.  
  34-year-old White was installed as Rangers' fourth manager on 1 November 1967. He had initially come to Rangers as assistant to manager Symon as part of a grooming process, giving him time to learn the ropes and take over when he was ready; however, White was on his own and in charge after five months at the club.  
  When White took up the reins at Rangers, the team had failed to win the league championship in three seasons, the longest title drought in fifty years. White won all but one of his first twenty league matches in charge, amassing 39 point out of a possible 40. The only blemish was a 2–2 draw at Celtic Park on 2 January 1968.  
  The Scottish Cup gave White his first defeat as Rangers manager. A third-round replay, against Hearts on 13 March 1968, looked to be heading for extra time when, in the 87th minute, Donald Ford struck the winner for the Edinburgh club. Rangers were out the cup, White's only loss in his first thirty domestic games in charge. A couple of draws in April, and White's first league defeat in the final minute of the final game of the season, 3–2 at home to Aberdeen, cost Rangers the title by two points. Despite accumulating the highest percentage of points won by any Rangers side since Bill Struth's first season, and collecting 61 points, Rangers were beaten to the title by Celtic by two points.  
  In the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup campaign that season, Rangers reached the quarter-finals, meeting Leeds United in March 1968. After a goalless draw at Ibrox, two goals in six minutes at Elland Road in the second leg were enough to see Leeds progress 2–0 aggregate. The Yorkshire club went on to win the competition.  
  The 1968–69 season was White's only full season in charge at the club. He made two major signings at the start of the season. The first was when he broke the Scottish transfer record and outbid the English Champions Everton to buy Colin Stein from Hibernian for £100,000. Secondly, he paid St Johnstone £50,000 for Alex MacDonald. The league campaign until the end of November was inconsistent, four draws and three defeats from thirteen matches, although the side did win the first Old Firm match 4–2 at Celtic Park. Rangers went on a run from December until April in which they lost only once in all competitions, 3–2 away to Airdrieonians in the league.  
  In the second half of March, Rangers beat Clyde 6–0 at Ibrox in the league, beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 at home in the Fairs Cup, and were 6–1 victors against Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup semi-final. Stein's disciplinary record caught up with him, and he was suspended from the end of March until the end of the season. Without his goals, the team dropped six points from the final six league games and conceded the title to Celtic by five points.  
  The route to the 1969 Scottish Cup Final saw Rangers dispose of Hibernian, Hearts and Airdrieonians, before meeting Aberdeen in the semi-final. In the final, with Stein suspended, White opted to play Alex Ferguson rather than Sandy Jardine, purely because of the aerial threat of Billy McNeill at corners. Ferguson was blamed for a goal that Rangers conceded two minutes into the match in which he was designated to mark goalscorer McNeill.[11] Two mistakes from Örjan Persson and Norrie Martin, minutes before the interval, were both seized upon by the 20-year-old George Connolly, resulting in two goals to give Celtic a 3–0 lead at half-time. Rangers lost the game 4–0, and Ferguson was subsequently forced to play for the club's junior side.[12]  
  The Fairs Cup proved fertile once again: Rangers went all the way to the semi-finals, defeating FK Vojvodina (2–1 on aggregate), Dundalk (9–1 on aggregate), DWS Amsterdam (4–1 on aggregate), Bilbao (4–3 on aggregate), before losing 2–0 on aggregate to eventual winners Newcastle United.  
  Having re-signed Jim Baxter at the start of the 1969–70 season, White's faith was repaid immediately when, in his first game back at Ibrox, Baxter was part of a notable 2–1 comeback victory over Celtic in the League Cup sectional round. In the Cup Winners' Cup, Rangers beat FCSB 2–0 at home, and held out in Bucharest for a goalless draw, in which John Greig was played in a sweeper's role.  
  In the second round, Rangers lost to Górnik Zabrze. White was sacked as manager. The next day, 27 November 1969, White's assistant Willie Thornton took over as caretaker and the club began to look for a new manager. In White's two seasons in charge, Rangers had finished two points and five points, respectively, behind Celtic. Willie Waddell, the former Rangers winger, was brought in as White's full-time successor. Waddell had won the championship in 1965 as manager of Kilmarnock, before returning to journalism with the Daily Express.  
  With Waddell in charge, the next three seasons saw Rangers finish twelve, fifteen and sixteen points adrift of Celtic in the championship race. The team also failed to beat Celtic in ten of the eleven games it played with Waddell at the helm.  
  Waddell era: European success and national tragedy (1969–1972)[edit]  
  This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (May 2022)  
  Waddell soon enforced a renewed discipline and order to the squad, and in 1972 he guided Rangers to their first and, to date, only European triumph when they defeated Dynamo Moscow 3–2 in the Cup Winners' Cup final at the Camp Nou in Barcelona. Due to a pitch invasion at the end of the match, the team were presented with the trophy in the dressing room, and UEFA banned Rangers from defending the cup.[13]  
  Within weeks of their European success, Waddell moved into a general-manager position, and his coach Jock Wallace was appointed as manager. The reasons for the 51-year-old Waddell relinquishing the reins at Rangers were never fully explained, but the triumph in the Cup Winners' Cup came sixteen months after the 1971 Ibrox disaster, in which 66 people died leaving the east terrace at staircase 13; after helping the families of the victims and forging strong links with supporters' clubs, Waddell was determined to complete the resultant reconstruction of Ibrox Stadium.  
  Jock Wallace's managership of Rangers saw the club achieve a period of sustained success. His first season as manager, 1972–73, was the club's centenary year. After taking over the first-team manager's position on 31 May 1972, Wallace set about reshaping the side. He moved on Colin Stein and Willie Johnston to Coventry City and West Bromwich Albion, respectively, bringing in Quinton Young, Joe Mason and Tom Forsyth.  
  After a stuttering start to the league campaign, including three defeats and a draw from their first six matches, Rangers' fortunes improved. From October to the end of the season, they suffered only one league defeat, at home to Hearts on 2 December 1972, and went on a run of sixteen victories; however, this run was not enough to beat Celtic to the championship. The Hoops claimed the title by a single point.  
  In the cup competitions, Rangers' Scottish Cup campaign culminated in a 3–2 win over Celtic. The final was attended by Princess Alexandra along with 122,714 other spectators. It was Rangers' first success in the competition in seven years. Their League Cup run was ended in the semi-finals at the hands of Hibernian after a single-goal defeat.  
  The 1972–73 season also saw inaugural competition in the European Super Cup. The side played the European Cup holders Ajax in January 1973. The Dutch side were the only continental opposition Rangers faced that season due to the club's European competition ban. Ajax recorded a 6–3 aggregate win, with Rangers losing 1–3 at Ibrox and 3–2 in Amsterdam.  
  In the summer of 1973, Rangers chairman John Lawerence retired and was replaced by vice-chairman Matt Taylor.  
  A nine-year period of Celtic dominance in the league was ended in 1974–75 as Rangers captured what was to be the last championship of its kind. The new ten-team Scottish Premier Division saw Rangers crowned inaugural champions, as part of a triumphant domestic treble. A barren season followed in 1976–77, however.  
  Jock Wallace presided over the club's fourth domestic treble, and their second in three years, in 1977–78. During the close season, Rangers spent heavily in the transfer market, bringing in Davie Cooper from Clydebank for £100,000 and Gordon Smith from Kilmarnock for £65,000. They were joined at the club by Bobby Russell, who arrived from Shettleston Juniors on a free transfer.  
  Despite these expensive signings, Rangers did not make the best start to the league campaign, losing the opening two matches to Aberdeen and Hibernian. Order was restored the following week with a 4–0 defeat of Partick Thistle. Rangers beat Celtic 3–2 in the first Old Firm match of the season, having been 2–0 down at half-time. In March 1978, second-placed Aberdeen won 3–0 at Ibrox to set up a tense title run-in. Rangers dropped seven points from twenty-one but held on by winning the final four fixtures to clinch the title.  
  The League Cup was won by defeating Celtic 2–1 after extra time. Goals from season new signings Cooper and Smith completed the first leg of the treble. The 2–1 1978 Scottish Cup Final win over Aberdeen made Wallace the only Rangers manager to win two domestic trebles. Despite this unprecedented success, Wallace resigned from his position on 23 May 1978. The reason for his departure was never stated, but it is believed that a breakdown in the working relationship between Wallace and general manager William Waddell was the cause. At a time when Ibrox Stadium was undergoing extensive redevelopment, the transfer budget was to suffer. Waddell was suspected of vetoing many signings, including Alan Hansen from Partick Thistle and David Narey from Dundee United, in favour of investing in the rebuilding project.  
  The burst of success under Wallace in the mid-1970s saw Rangers once again established as Scotland's most successful club. When Wallace, suddenly and unexpectedly, announced his resignation, Rangers turned to another former player, John Greig.  
  John Greig, from captain to manager (1978–1983)[edit]  
  After the departure of Wallace, the board acted quickly to replace the void with captain Greig being promoted to first-team manager. Greig took a phone call on the day of Wallace's resignation from general manager Waddell. Greig was playing golf with teammate Sandy Jardine when Waddell called him to offer him the job. On 24 May 1978, Greig was confirmed as the seventh manager of Rangers.  
  In the 1978–79 season, despite a fixture pile-up which resulted from the club playing three league games in nearly three months, Rangers came close to winning a quadruple of trophies. The season ended with a domestic cup double.  
  Wallace's treble-winning team of the previous season carried the team in the 1978–79 European Cup. Rangers eliminated Juventus after defeating the Italians 2–1 on aggregate – the first time Rangers had ever recovered from a first-leg defeat to win a two-legged European tie. Dutch side PSV Eindhoven, the then UEFA Cup holders, were overcome in the next round (the club's first home defeat in European competition), before an injury-stricken Rangers side lost to Cologne at the quarter-finals stage.  
  Poor early-season league form saw the team fail to win any of the first six league matches, but a run was eventually put together. Things began to unravel again, however, as leadership of the league evaporated. The team had to settle for second place behind Celtic. The pivotal match was a 4–2 Old Firm defeat at Parkhead. There was success for Greig in the national cup competitions. Victory in the 1979 Scottish Cup Final over Hibernian required a second replay to separate the sides before Rangers eventually won 3–2. The 1979 Scottish League Cup Final ended in a 2–1 win for Rangers over a strong Aberdeen with goals from Alex MacDonald and Colin Jackson.  
  The following season finished trophyless. Rangers finished fifth in the league, eleven points behind champions Aberdeen, who also knocked them out of the Scottish League Cup over a two-legged third-round tie. Rangers did reach the 1980 Scottish Cup Final, only to lose out to Celtic after a deflected George McCluskey shot in extra time. The European Cup Winner's Cup campaign was ended by the eventual winners Valencia after having seen off Lillestrøm and Fortuna Düsseldorf in previous rounds.  
  The summer of 1980 saw Greig bring in Jim Bett from Lokeren for £150,000. Bett was joined by Colin McAdam, a £165,000 signing from Partick Thistle. The side began the season with a fifteen-match unbeaten run, including two Old Firm wins, which ended in November. A poor run in November and December all but ended the title challenge as the team finished third, twelve points behind champions Celtic. The League Cup campaign was halted after a controversial defeat by Aberdeen in a match in which the Dons were awarded two contentious penalties. Due to having no European participation, Rangers entered the Anglo-Scottish Cup, which led to defeat at the hands of English minnows Chesterfield. The Third Division side held Rangers to a 1–1 draw at Ibrox before defeating Rangers 3–0 in the leg at Saltergate. Rangers did win the 1981 Scottish Cup Final after beating Dundee United 4–1 in a final replay. After a goalless draw, during which Ian Redford missed a last-minute penalty, Rangers won the replay with goals from Davie Cooper, a John MacDonald double and Bobby Russell.  
  Greig's fourth season in charge, 1981–82, ended yet again without the league championship. Rangers finished third, twelve points behind champions Celtic.  
  There followed the surprise signing of Northern Ireland international John McClelland from Mansfield Town. The Ulsterman later became club captain. European participation was halted by Dukla Prague, who soundly beat the team 3–0 in Prague. A 2–1 second-leg win for Rangers was not enough for the team to progress. The domestic cup competitions provided successful ground as Rangers reached both finals. The team lost the 1982 Scottish Cup Final 4–1 to Aberdeen, despite leading for the majority of the match. A late Aberdeen equaliser took the game into extra time, before Aberdeen scored three more goals. Rangers did win the 1982 Scottish League Cup Final by defeating Dundee United 2–1 with goals from Davie Cooper and Ian Redford.  
  Greig made big-money signings in the pre-season of 1982–83 with renewed hope that they could at least mount a serious title challenge, but once again, the season ended trophyless. Dave MacKinnon (£30,000 from Partick Thistle), Craig Paterson (£200,000 from Hibernian), Robert Prytz (from Malmö) and Sandy Clark (from West Ham) all arrived at the club.  
  Rangers reached the 1983 Scottish League Cup Final, scoring 29 goals in their ten games, and eliminated Borussia Dortmund from the UEFA Cup. The opening eight league games saw the side unbeaten, but the final match saw Rangers lying in fourth, eighteen points behind eventual champions Dundee United. The team was knocked out of Europe after suffering a 5–0 defeat to Cologne. The 1983 Scottish Cup Final was lost to an Aberdeen side that had won the European Cup Winner's Cup ten days earlier.  
  The 1983–84 season signalled the end of John Greig's managerial career. The league season began with Rangers obtaining one point from the first four league games, although the team did win their six League Cup games under Greig. A fruitful brief run in the European Cup Winner's Cup saw Rangers win the second round, first leg tie 2–1 against Porto after the team's record-breaking 18–0 aggregate win over Maltese champions Valletta. After the first nine league games, Greig's team had collected ten points from twenty-seven. In the end, the pressure was too much and Greig resigned from his post on 28 October 1983.  
  During this period, attendances at Ibrox dwindled from an average 25,628 in season 1978–79 to 17,681 in 1982–83.[14]  
  Rangers brought Jock Wallace back to the club following his exile in England with Leicester City. Wallace, though, was not the club's first choice: Jim McLean and Alex Ferguson, the then managers of the New Firm clubs, both rebuffed Rangers' advances.[15] McLean's brother, Tommy, was appointed caretaker manager, and four games passed before a permanent manager was in position.  
  On 10 November 1983, Wallace was persuaded by the Rangers board to leave Motherwell and return to the club.[15] Wallace's initial impact was positive, boosting morale and fitness. He made changes to the coaching staff, bringing in Alex Totten as first-team coach, with Tommy McLean, David Provan and Joe Mason leaving the club.[15] Wallace also added to the squad during the season: Bobby Williamson arrived from Clydebank, Nicky Walker from Wallace's old club Motherwell, and Stuart Munro from Alloa Athletic.[15]  
  Wallace's first match back in the hotseat was at Pittodrie on 12 November 1983. The game ended in a 3–0 victory for Aberdeen, but Rangers went on a 22-match unbeaten run in all competitions thenceforth until March 1984.[15] They ended the season fourth in the league, fifteen points behind champions Aberdeen. The club did win a trophy, the League Cup. The League Cup Final was an extra-time victory over Celtic, with Ally McCoist scoring a hat-trick in a 3–2 win.[15]  
  The 1984–85 season, Wallace's first full season in charge since his return, was almost a carbon-copy of the previous campaign. Rangers again finished fourth in the league, but it was by a record twenty-one-point margin behind champions Aberdeen. This performance was not caused due to a lack of investment in the playing squad,[15] for a total of £495,000 was spent bringing in Iain Ferguson and Cammy Fraser from Dundee, Ted McMinn from Queen of the South, and the return of Derek Johnstone from Chelsea.[15] The club won the Scottish League Cup for the second season in a row, defeating Dundee United in the Final. A solitary Iain Ferguson strike gave Rangers the win.[15]  
  At the start of Wallace's second full season in charge, five wins out of six matches in the league were attained, plus a further two wins in the League Cup; however, things quickly began to sour as a fall out between manager and then club captain John McClelland saw the latter stripped of the captaincy. McClelland was soon sold to Watford in November 1985 for £265,000.[15] By the turn of the new year, Rangers were in third position in the league. From 1 January 1986, the side won only a quarter of the remaining sixteen league fixtures. There was no hope of a trophy, after defeats in the Scottish Cup third round and the League Cup semi-final.[15]  
  Wallace resigned as manager of the club on 7 April 1986.[15] He was to jump before being pushed by the then newly appointed Rangers chairman David Holmes. Holmes had gone on record saying that the slump the club was in could not be allowed to go on.[15] Wallace's side might have won the League Cup twice in a row, but the league form remained indifferent. The continuing dominance of the Aberdeen side of the 1980s, coupled with strong Dundee United and Celtic teams that offered periodic challenges to Aberdeen's ascendancy, placed Wallace under increasing pressure. By the 1985–86 season, Rangers had slipped to fifth place in the league.  
  The search for Wallace's replacement was a brief one.  
  On 7 April 1986, Graeme Souness was appointed as Rangers' first player-manager by chairman David Holmes.[16] Souness had previously been playing in Italy with Sampdoria, and made the move to Glasgow for a £300,000 fee. This was the first of many big-money transfer deals to be made at Ibrox. Souness' first moves were to bring in Walter Smith from Dundee United as his assistant[17] and ex-Coventry City manager Don Mackay as reserve-team coach.  
  Souness' first match in charge of Rangers was the club's final league fixture of the season, on 3 May 1986. Souness and Smith were introduced to the 22,000 crowd at Ibrox and were given a rousing reception. The team then went on to defeat Motherwell 2–0 to clinch the final qualification spot for the following season's UEFA Cup in what had been an otherwise unnotable year for the club.[18] Six days later, Souness won his first trophy at Rangers when they defeated Celtic 3–2 after extra time in the Glasgow Cup Final, Ally McCoist scored a hat-trick in front of over 40,000 fans at Ibrox.[19]  
  Souness' first flurry into the transfer market over the summer resulted in a £175,000 purchase of Colin West. The investment made in West was small compared to that made in other members of the playing staff. Souness took advantage of the European competition ban imposed by UEFA on English clubs after the Heysel Stadium Disaster.[17] Due to this, plus a sizeable transfer budget,[20] he was able to attract the cream of English clubs' talent.[21] The first of many international players arrived in the shape of Chris Woods,[17] followed by the likes of England deputy captain Terry Butcher[17] and former Manchester United defender Jimmy Nicholl.  
  The 1986–87 season was the first time in eight seasons that Rangers finished top of the Scottish Premier Division. However, the season began eventfully with player-manager Souness being sent-off in the first league match of the season.[16] A foul on Hibernian's George McCluskey meant Souness had to watch the 2–1 defeat from the stands.[16] But thirty-one wins, seven draws and five defeats later, Rangers were the champions. The league crown was not Souness' only trophy that season, however, for a 2–1 win over Celtic gave them a 1986 Scottish League Cup Final win.  
  That same season, goalkeeper Chris Woods set the then British football clean sheet record of 1,196 minutes: from 26 November 1986, when he conceded a goal in a UEFA Cup 1–1 draw with Borussia Mönchengladbach until fourteen games later, on 30 January 1987, when Adrian Sprott of Hamilton Academical knocked Rangers out of the Scottish Cup by a single goal.[22]  
  The following season, Rangers could not build on the success of the previous campaign, despite the arrivals of Trevor Francis, Ray Wilkins, Mark Walters, Mark Falco, John Brown and Richard Gough, who became Scotland's first £1 million player. The title defence began with three points from the first ten. That, added to injuries and suspensions, meant the club finished third, twelve points behind champions Celtic. There was League Cup Final victory over Aberdeen, however, and a run in the European Cup with Dynamo Kyiv and Górnik Zabrze as scalps. The Scottish Cup ended in the fourth round at the hands of Dunfermline Athletic.  
  The 1988–89 season was to start what would be one of the most successful spells in Rangers' history. When Souness' side regained the league championship by a margin of six points from second-placed Aberdeen, it became the first of nine.[17] The club had again invested heavily in the playing staff, and again the club imported players from English sides, with Gary Stevens joining from Everton and Kevin Drinkell from Norwich City.  
  The team was unbeaten in all competitions in August and September, including a 5–1 victory over Celtic at Ibrox. Rangers collected fifty-six points from thirty-six games, twenty-six of which were victories. The League Cup was again at Ibrox as the side again beat Aberdeen. The final came just a fortnight after the sides met in the league. Rangers lost 2–1. During the game, Aberdeen's Neil Simpson's tackle on Rangers midfielder Ian Durrant left the latter with a knee injury that kept him out for over three years. But for a single-goal defeat by Celtic in the 1989 Scottish Cup Final, the treble would have rested at Ibrox that season.  
  The arrival of businessman David Murray in 1988 continued the Rangers resurgence. Murray had acquired Rangers for £6 million from the Nevada-based Lawrence Marlborough on 23 November 1988.[23] Murray officially became chairman on 2 June 1989, replacing David Holmes.  
  Murray retained the ambitious strategy he had inherited from Holmes. This was demonstrated on 10 July 1989, when Rangers, acting on Souness' wishes, purchased former Celtic striker Mo Johnston from Nantes for £1.5 million.[17] The fact that Rangers signed an ex-Celtic player would have been a big enough story, but Johnston was also a high-profile Roman Catholic. The transfer angered both sides of the Old Firm support. Rangers, seen as the Protestant club in Glasgow, had a policy of not employing Catholics. Celtic fans saw Johnston as a turncoat who had already committed to re-join Celtic from Nantes before Rangers made known their interest.  
  After three matches in the league, Rangers had no wins and two defeats. New arrival Johnston netted the crucial winner during an Old Firm game on 4 November 1989. Scoring the goal in the dying minutes of the match meant Johnston was all but forgiven by the Rangers support. Come May 1990, Rangers' name was on the trophy for the second time in as many seasons, but the club again failed to win the Scottish Cup, losing to Celtic in the fourth round. The side lost to Aberdeen by 2–1 in the Scottish League Cup Final.  
  The 1990–91 season would be Souness's last in charge. On 16 April 1991, he departed for his former club Liverpool before the league campaign reached its dramatic culmination, saying he had "gone as far as he would be allowed to go". A final-day victory over Aberdeen at Ibrox gave Rangers three championships in a row. Souness' assistant Walter Smith was in charge that day. Before his departure, Souness sold club captain Terry Butcher and spent big money on striker Mark Hateley, winger Pieter Huistra and forgotten man Oleg Kuznetsov. Souness was never to win a Scottish Cup with Rangers, as the team went down 2–0 to Celtic at Parkhead. The 1990 Scottish League Cup Final ended in victory, however.  
  Walter Smith was appointed the ninth manager of Rangers on 19 April 1991, the eve of a crucial Scottish Premier Division match at St Mirren. Smith guided the side to a single-goal victory, and followed that with a similar result at home to Dundee United, before a 3–0 loss at Motherwell nearly derailed the side's championship hopes. The final league game of the season was at home to fellow title challengers Aberdeen, with a draw being all that was needed by the Dons to be crowned champions. A tense match ensued, but a Mark Hateley brace in front of a 37,652-strong Ibrox crowd gave Rangers the win and the league championship.  
  A fourth-successive championship was secured that season, for the first time in over sixty years. Rangers topped the division with a total of seventy-two points, nine ahead of second-placed Hearts. The side scored 101 goals and were victorious in nineteen of their twenty-two away fixtures. The success continued into the Scottish Cup as Rangers won the 1992 final, beating Airdrieonians 2–1 to win the trophy for the first time in eleven years.  
  The 1992–93 season was arguably one of the most successful in the club's history, and the best European campaign since 1972. Not only did the team win the domestic treble but they also came to within one match of the 1993 UEFA Champions League Final. Rangers saw off English First Division champions Leeds United in a tie dubbed the Battle of Britain. Then, in the group stage, Rangers won two matches and drew four but, despite remaining undefeated, went out to Marseille, who were later found guilty of match fixing. No foul play was found with regards to the Rangers matches, however.  
  Duncan Ferguson became Britain's most expensive footballer upon his move to Rangers from Dundee United for £4 million in July 1993.[24]  
  Rangers won the double the following season but missed out on a back-to-back domestic treble after losing in the 1994 Scottish Cup Final to Dundee United. It was a classic giant-killing act. United had had a fairly moderate season, winning eleven of their forty-four league matches. It was United's seventh appearance in a Scottish Cup Final, having lost all six of their previous encounters. A forty-seventh minute Craig Brewster goal gave Dundee United the win after a back pass by Dave McPherson was intercepted.  
  The 1994–95 season saw Rangers make two big-money signings, Basile Boli and Brian Laudrup, for £2.7 million and £2.4 million, respectively. A sixth-consecutive championship was won. The club sat top of the Scottish Premier Division on sixty-nine points, fifteen points ahead of second-placed Motherwell. Both runs in the domestic cup competitions ended before the last eight, as well as a failure to reach the UEFA Champions League group stage.  
  Rangers won the championship again in season 1995–96 with the help of Paul Gascoigne. The Englishman was signed on 10 July 1995 from Lazio. He made an instant impact at Rangers, running almost the length of the pitch to score in an Old Firm match at Celtic Park during the fifth league game of the season. Rangers went on to win the league, clinching the title in the penultimate game of the season against Aberdeen. After Rangers went 1–0 down in the early stages, Gascoigne went on to score a hat-trick to give the club a 3–1 victory and the championship. Joining the league crown in the Ibrox trophy cabinet was the 1996 Scottish Cup, which Rangers won after a 5–1 defeat of Hearts. A hat-trick from Gordon Durie and a Brian Laudrup double won Rangers their 27th Scottish Cup.  
  In season 1996–97, Rangers went on to win their ninth championship in a row, thereby equalling Celtic's achievement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the cup competitions, they were knocked out of the Scottish Cup at the quarter-finals stage, losing 2–0 to Celtic; however, the team won the League Cup, defeating Hearts 4–3. In Europe, the team qualified for the UEFA Champions League after a 10–3 aggregate win over Russian champions Alania Vladikavkaz. They recorded three points from their six group matches.  
  The season 1997–98 proved to be Walter Smith's last season as manager, and Rangers were unable to win a record tenth-straight league championship. The early-season form of new signing Marco Negri gave the team fresh impetus. The side finished the league on 72 points, two behind champions Celtic, after taking the title race to the last day of the season.  
  The club ended the season trophyless for the first time in twelve seasons as they lost the 1998 Scottish Cup Final to Hearts 2–1 and were knocked out League Cup in the quarter-finals by Dundee United. In Europe, the club failed to reach the Champions League group stages and they fell at the first hurdle in the UEFA Cup, losing both legs 2–1 to RC Strasbourg. Smith left Rangers and joined Premier League club Everton. Many players from the nine-in-a-row era left Rangers, including Brian Laudrup, Ally McCoist, Ian Durrant, Stuart McCall and club captain Richard Gough.[25]  
  Dick Advocaat, nicknamed the Little General,[26] succeeded Walter Smith on 1 June 1998. Formerly in charge of PSV Eindhoven, Advocaat became Rangers' tenth manager, and was the first non-Scot to hold the position. His appointment was viewed as reflecting a desire to begin to challenge Europe's elite clubs. David Murray had long proclaimed that Rangers ought to be judged not just in relation to success in Scotland but on their performance in European competition, and especially in the UEFA Champions League. Despite being given resources on a scale never before handed to a Rangers manager, success on a larger stage failed to materialise.  
  The scale of these resources made available to Advocaat initially confirmed that the Rangers management was thinking in bold, European terms. Confronted with a rump of players remaining after Smith's departure, Advocaat was furnished with an unprecedented transfer budget over the coming seasons. In total, Advocaat spent over £36 million on new players in his debut season. However, while Advocaat's record in transfer dealings remained mixed throughout his time at Ibrox, at first the club appeared to be beginning to deliver in playing terms, both in Scotland and (less predictably) Europe. Advocaat's first season saw another domestic treble secured. Performance in Europe was promising, with Bayer Leverkusen defeated in a solid, if unspectacular, UEFA Cup run.  
  The following season, Advocaat continued to spend big, bringing the likes of Michael Mols and Claudio Reyna to Ibrox. A domestic double was secured in Advocaat's second season. In Europe, too, there were signs of greatly improved performance in the Champions League, as Parma were defeated en route to qualification for the group stages of the competition. During this season, Rangers Football Club Ltd traded on what was the Ofex market.[27]  
  Rangers entered Advocaat's third season emboldened by the capture of five of the six domestic trophies available in his first two years; however, while the club again qualified for the Champions League group stage, performances in the league began rapidly to disintegrate. Further high-profile signings – Tore André Flo, for a club record £12 million, and the Dutch internationalist Ronald de Boer – could not reverse the decline. The club failed to win a major competition in the 2000–01 season, as Celtic swept the domestic board. Having continued in similar fashion in 2001–02, and with Martin O'Neill's Celtic side once more running away with the championship, Advocaat resigned as manager and took up a general-manager position, which he left just under a year later. Alex McLeish was appointed the new Rangers manager in December 2001.  
  Murray Park, a £14m training complex, was constructed at Auchenhowie. Its existence was viewed as essential if the club was to compete with its European peers in nurturing home-grown talent and developing players.  
  Financial constraints under McLeish (2001–2006)[edit]  
  McLeish, Rangers' eleventh manager, appointed Andy Watson as his assistant.[28] Others said to be included on the shortlist of prospective managers were the then Ipswich Town manager George Burley, former Germany coach Berti Vogts and ex-Arsenal manager George Graham.[29]  
  In McLeish's first full season as manager, 2002–03, the club won its seventh domestic treble. The Scottish Premier League title was secured after a tense run-in. Going into the final round, both sides were equal on 94 points, but Rangers had a one-goal advantage and sat top of the league.[31] On a dramatic last day, a 6–1 victory over Dunfermline Athletic denied Celtic the title on goal-difference after the Parkhead club beat Kilmarnock 4–0. The destination of the title was unknown until the final seconds of this match, with both teams level on points and goal-difference. Only a last-minute penalty by Mikel Arteta clinched the league title for Rangers.[32][33]  
  A victory over Celtic in the 2003 Scottish League Cup Final, in March, provided the first piece of the club's seventh treble.[34] A 1–0 victory over Dundee in the 2003 Scottish Cup Final, the following May, saw a triumphant finalé to the season.[35] It was a near-flawless start to McLeish's reign, ruined only by a poor showing in Europe, which Rangers exited in the first round to minnows Viktoria Žižkov.[36]  
  The following season, McLeish's initial period as manager proved difficult to sustain. The club's perilous financial position in the wake of the profligacy of the Advocaat era, meant a period of relative austerity. The wage bill had to be slashed as the club embarked on an extensive cost-cutting programme in an attempt to stabilise a mushrooming and unsustainable level of debt. Confronted with a squad of well-paid but ageing players, McLeish was compelled to rebuild without the luxury of the generous transfer fund enjoyed by some of his predecessors. McLeish was to lose, from his treble-winning squad, defender Lorenzo Amoruso, Scottish international winger Neil McCann and club captain midfielder Barry Ferguson. In their place, McLeish was required to rebuild with only the use of Bosman free transfers and loan signings.  
  After a good start to the 2003–04 season, which saw the side top of the league and qualify for UEFA Champions League (thanks to a dramatic late goal in Denmark against Copenhagen), a dramatic downturn in results ultimately resulted in a trophyless campaign. McLeish's signings of experienced players, such as the Brazilian midfielder Emerson, Norway forward Egil Østenstad and the £600,000 signing of Portuguese winger Nuno Capucho proved costly in more ways than one.  
  The 2004–05 season started in the same vein, with McLeish making another questionable signing in Serbian midfielder Dragan Mladenovic for £1 million. The Serb played fewer than ten games for the club. On the pitch, the team again fell behind Celtic in the league and exited the Champions League at the qualifying stage. It was rumoured that failure to gain entry into the new UEFA Cup group stage would see McLeish lose his job, but another late goal and a penalty shootout win over Marítimo of Portugal provided him with a stay of execution. After this, his fortunes began to turn again. New arrivals included Nacho Novo, plus the Bosmans Dado Pršo, Jean-Alain Boumsong and midfielder Alex Rae. Once these players settled in, the team began to recover ground lost to O'Neill's ageing Celtic side. Boumsong, in particular, was a marked success, but he was sold in January 2005, after only six months at the club, to then Premier League side Newcastle United (managed by former Gers boss Graeme Souness) for £8 million. This cash paved the way for more signings, including Thomas Buffel, Sotirios Kyrgiakos and the return of Barry Ferguson.  
  The 2005 Scottish League Cup Final, in March 2005, ended in a 5–1 victory over Motherwell;[37] the league, however, appeared to have been lost. Despite catching and overtaking Celtic (with two Old Firm wins, including a pivotal 2–0 victory at Celtic Park in what was McLeish's first win there as Rangers manager), a loss to their city rivals, in the last derby of the season at Ibrox, handed Celtic a five-point lead with only four games remaining, and seemed to end hopes of the title. Rangers kept its winnings way, however, and Celtic's 3–1 home defeat to Hibernian meant only two points separated the sides going into the final game of the season. Rangers needed to win at Hibernian and hope that Celtic would drop points at Fir Park. In perhaps even more dramatic circumstances than two years previously,[38] Motherwell overcame a 1–0 deficit, with two goals in injury time from Scott McDonald, to defeat the Parkhead side, while Rangers edged out a tight single-goal victory at Easter Road. The helicopter that was carrying the league trophy was on its way to Motherwell, so it had to turn around and fly to Edinburgh. That day has passed into Ibrox folklore, becoming known as Helicopter Sunday. McLeish could celebrate his second, and Rangers' 51st, league title.  
  The 2005–06 season saw Rangers win six league games out of the first 17, being knocked out of the League Cup by Celtic in the process. The period from October through to early December saw the team embark on, statistically, the worst run in their history, going ten games without a win. During this time, however, the club became the first Scottish side to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League, yet there was still significant pressure on McLeish from fans due to the club's poor position in the domestic league table.  
  After a period of uncertainty around the manager's future, David Murray stated that McLeish would remain in charge indefinitely,[39] but did concede that domestic results would need to improve. After this announcement, the team's results did improve, helped by the signing from Kilmarnock of Kris Boyd. The side strung together a ten-match unbeaten run, but, entering the crucial month of February, which was to feature a must-win Old Firm match and the resumption of European football, this evaporated. Rangers lost 3–0 at home to Hibernian on 4 February to exit the Scottish Cup and end their last realistic hopes of silverware that season. Protests against McLeish and the chairman followed the game.[40] After signs that supporter unrest was turning on Murray, on 9 February 2006, two days before the crucial Old Firm match, it was announced that McLeish would leave his position as manager at the end of the 2005–06 season.[41] On 11 March, it was confirmed that former Lyon manager Paul Le Guen would succeed McLeish.[42]  
  Murray predicted a fruitful reign under Le Guen, describing his capture as "a massive moonbeam of success" for the club and promising the club had "got big plans".[43] He announced that the Frenchman would be given significant funds with which to strengthen the squad, with Rangers having announced an arrangement with sports retailer JJB Sports.  
  Le Guen was well known for unearthing and nurturing young talent, and he made an immediate splash in the transfer market. In the summer of 2006, he made eleven signings (of those, however, only Saša Papac stayed beyond their first season). Le Guen spent big money on Filip Šebo, but the Slovakian only netted twice during the campaign. Other signings including Karl Svensson, Libor Sionko and Lionel Letizi, while Jérémy Clément was to be in Glasgow for only six months.  
  Rangers' first match under Le Guen was a friendly against Irish Premier League champions Linfield on 6 July 2006 at Windsor Park, Belfast. The visitors won 2–0, with first-half goals from Kris Boyd and Thomas Buffel. The squad then flew out to South Africa on 9 July for a training camp where they were to also play three matches. Defender Fernando Ricksen did not take any part in the tour, due to what was described by the club as "unacceptable behaviour" on the flight to Johannesburg.[50] He returned to Scotland and was subsequently loaned to Zenit St Petersburg on 9 August.[51] Ricksen never played for the club again as his loan spell in Russia was made permanent.[52]  
  The Scottish Premier League season opened on 30 July, with Le Guen taking his Rangers side to Fir Park, where they defeated Motherwell 2–1.[53] In Le Guen's first competitive game at Ibrox, Rangers were held to a 2–2 draw by Dundee United, and were forced to come back from two goals down.[54] On 11 August, Rangers signed Manchester United's 19-year-old winger Lee Martin on loan for the season.[55] They also recruited the services of Austrian Vienna defender Saša Papac,[56] while Marvin Andrews, Olivier Bernard, Bob Malcolm and José-Karl Pierre-Fanfan all departed.[57]  
  With the transfer window closed and five league matches played, Rangers had collected nine points from fifteen. The next two months showed little improvement as the side had sporadic wins, and they lost the first Old Firm match of the season 2–0. From the seven matches played in September and October 2006, the team won three and gathered ten points from the twenty-one available.  
  By mid-November, Rangers found themselves in third place, fifteen points behind leaders Celtic. The odd win was mixed with regular dropped points as the team struggled to find consistency in the early part of the season. The club was knocked out of the League Cup by then-First Division side St Johnstone. The 2–0 defeat at Ibrox on 8 November led to widespread calls for Le Guen to leave.[58][59]  
  Following the League Cup defeat, there was a slight gain in form as the side claimed sixteen points from twenty-one, including a 1–1 Old Firm draw, thanks to a last-minute Brahim Hemdani equaliser. Rangers also became the first Scottish club to qualify from the UEFA Cup group stage in December 2006, after wins over Livorno, Maccabi Haifa and Partizan Belgrade. Domestic results and performances, however, continued to be inconsistent and in January 2007, Le Guen controversially stripped midfielder Barry Ferguson of the captaincy.[60]  
  On 4 January 2007, Le Guen left Rangers by mutual consent.[61] This made him the club's shortest-serving manager, and the only one to leave the club without completing a full season in charge. Later that year, sports journalist Graham Spiers published a book which speculated Le Guen left the club because he was being "undermined" by other Rangers personnel. Those named were Ferguson and the then club doctor Ian McGuinness.[62]  
  Following the departure of Paul Le Guen, a number of media sources reported an "understanding" that the new management structure would consist of former Rangers duo Walter Smith and Ally McCoist, and the SFA confirmed that Rangers enquired about the availability of the pair;[63] however, on 8 January, the SFA rebuffed Rangers' approach for Smith.[63]  
  On 10 January 2007, it was announced that Smith was the new manager of Rangers, with McCoist confirmed as assistant manager and Kenny McDowall as first-team coach.[63] Smith and his team undertook some serious changes to the side.[64] They signed experienced defenders David Weir, Ugo Ehiogu and Andy Webster to shore-up the back line.  
  The following summer, Smith made ten signings, including defender Carlos Cuéllar and midfielder Lee McCulloch. The early-season priority, qualification for the Champions League group stage, was secured after aggregate victories over the champions of the Montenegrin and Serbian leagues FK Zeta and Red Star Belgrade, respectively. Rangers were drawn in Group E, to play Barcelona, French champions Lyon and German champions Stuttgart. The campaign started well for Rangers with two victories, 2–1 at home to Stuttgart and 3–0 against Lyon at the Stade Gerland, as well as a goalless draw against Barcelona at Ibrox. They lost matchday six against Lyon 3–0, which ended their 2007–08 UEFA Champions League run. The adventure continued as they progressed to the final of the UEFA Cup, defeating Panathinaikos, Werder Bremen, Sporting Lisbon and Fiorentina along the way. They beat Fiorentina on penalties to set up a final, in Manchester, against Zenit St. Petersburg, who were managed by former Gers manager Dick Advocaat.[65] The team lost that match 2–0, amid serious disturbances caused by small sections of the 100,000-strong Rangers support. Video evidence was released by the Greater Manchester Police of suspected Rangers fans attacking officers in Manchester city centre following the defeat.[66] An appeal was launched on BBC's Crimewatch programme in January 2009 in an attempt to trace 49 men in connection with the riots.[67]  
  On the domestic front, the race for the Scottish Premier League continued until the final matchday of the season. Both Celtic and Rangers were tied on 86 points going into their games (against Dundee United and Aberdeen, respectively) on 22 May 2008, but Celtic were top of the table due to having a better goal-difference of 57, four more than Rangers. This did not prove to be decisive, however, as Rangers surrendered their hopes of landing the championship with a 2–0 defeat at Pittodrie. The club had held a ten-point lead in late March.  
  On 16 March 2008, Rangers appeared in their first final since 2005. They played Dundee United in the League Cup Final, and won on penalties. The match was tied 2–2 after extra time, with both goals coming from Kris Boyd, who also scored the winning spot kick. They also reached the 2009 Scottish Cup Final, the club's 50th such appearance. The side had beaten St Johnstone 4–3 on penalties in the semi-final after the score was tied at 1–1 after extra time. The final was against Queen of the South and was played on 24 May 2008, two days after the decisive Old Firm fixture that had ended in Celtic's favour. Rangers won the final 3–2, thanks to goals from DaMarcus Beasley and a double from Kris Boyd.  
  The 2008–09 season began with an exit from the UEFA Champions League and European football altogether, losing 2–1 on aggregate to Kaunas in the second qualifying round. The first leg at Ibrox finished goalless, but the return leg in Lithuania ended in defeat for Rangers after an 87th-minute header from Linas Pilibaitis. The financial consequences of the failures to qualify for the Champions League were revealed when the club posted a loss of £3.9 million for the six months to December 2008, and in March decided to offer staff the option of voluntary redundancy as a way of cutting costs.[68] Player departures included Chris Burke, Jean-Claude Darcheville and a couple out-on-loan deals, but the increased debt meant that the club needed to find a cash injection. This resulted in the attempted sale of Kris Boyd to Birmingham City, which fell through due to the player's wage demands.[69]  
  In the first Old Firm game of the season, Rangers won 4–2, with Pedro Mendes scoring his first goal for the club and Kenny Miller scoring a double against his former employers. However, the team's league form stuttered thereafter. Despite a run of five wins from six matches following the Old Firm victory, the side trailed Celtic by seven points in the league at the turn of the year. For the first few months of 2009, both sides dropped and gained points on the other, and Rangers briefly took over top spot of the Premier League on 21 February after a win against Kilmarnock. The spell as league leaders lasted less than a fortnight. A defeat and a draw, both at home, to Inverness and Hearts, respectively, saw Walter Smith's side sit second in the table, one point behind Celtic, at the split. The fourth Old Firm league meeting of the season finished with a single-goal victory to Rangers, a Steven Davis strike. This meant that, with three league games remaining, Rangers were two points ahead of their arch-rivals. Further twists and turns followed; both Old Firm sides drew their matches against Hibernian at Easter Road, leaving Rangers two points clear with one round of matches remaining. Rangers needed a win against Dundee United to guarantee the club's 52nd league title. Goals from Kyle Lafferty, Pedro Mendes and Kris Boyd sealed a 3–0 win and the club's first league championship in four seasons.[70]  
  The club played in the finals of both of the domestic cup competitions for the second season running. The 2009 Scottish League Cup Final was reached by defeating Partick Thistle, Hamilton and Falkirk en route, but the final ended in a 2–0 defeat at the hands of Celtic after extra time. The match was Walter Smith's first-ever Old Firm final and was marred by a Kirk Broadfoot sending off deep into extra time for a foul on Aiden McGeady inside the penalty box. Celtic were subsequently awarded a penalty, which McGeady himself converted.[71] Rangers qualified for the 2009 Scottish Cup Final after beating St Mirren 3–0 in the semi-final. The second goal of the game was scored by Kris Boyd, his 100th goal for Rangers. The team faced Falkirk at Hampden Park on 30 May 2009 in what was the club's 51st Scottish Cup Final appearance. A Nacho Novo strike in the first minute of the second half gave Rangers a 1–0 win and completed their domestic double.[72]  
  The following season saw Rangers' financial problems continue. A quiet summer in terms of transfer arrivals contrasted to the outgoings. The club removed eleven players who had made first-team appearances from the wage bill on permanent and loan deals. The only addition to the playing staff was Jérôme Rothen on a season-long loan. Rothen was the first player to sign for the club in over a year.[73] On 26 August, chairman David Murray stepped down and was replaced by non-executive director Alastair Johnston.[74] Johnston stated that one of his main priorities was to find a buyer for owner Murray's shares.[75] On 24 October, Rangers manager Walter Smith was reported to say that Lloyds Banking Group, who the club was in debt to, was "effectively running the club".[76][77] On 12 November, the extent of the club's financial problems was shown to be a debt of £31 million, a rise of £10m from the previous year.[78]  
  On the field, Rangers' Scottish Premier League title defence got off to a stuttering start: three wins in the league was followed by three draws, the first Old Firm victory of the season was followed by dropped points at home to Hibernian. The side lost their first league match of the season away to Aberdeen on 28 November but then embarked on a six-match winning run, scoring 26 goals in the process. At the start of 2010, Rangers sat at the top of the league. The second Old Firm fixture finished in a 1–1 draw. Rangers had a ten-point lead by mid-February.[79] They won the third Old Firm match 1–0, thanks to an injury-time winner from Maurice Edu, which all but secured the title.[80] The side had to wait nearly two months to be confirmed as champions due to dropping points to St Johnstone and Dundee United. On 25 April, Rangers won their 53rd league title after defeating Hibernian 1–0 at Easter Road.[81]  
  In the domestic cup competitions, Rangers won the League Cup after a 1–0 victory over St Mirren in the final, despite being reduced to nine men, with Danny Wilson and Kevin Thomson being sent off. However, they were unable to retain the Scottish Cup after losing 1–0 to eventual winners Dundee United in a quarter-final replay.  
  Rangers were seeded in pot two of the UEFA Champions League group stage for the first time. The club was drawn against Sevilla, Stuttgart and Unirea Urziceni. A 1–1 draw in Stuttgart was followed by two consecutive 4–1 defeats at home to Sevilla and Unirea, the latter being regarded as one of the club's worst-ever European results.[82][83] Rangers were left with a small chance of qualifying from the group after a 1–1 draw in the return leg with Unirea, a match that saw trouble in the Rangers fans section of the stadium. The club was charged by UEFA for inappropriate conduct,[84] and following an investigation was fined €20,000 and ordered to pay the cost of repairing the damage to the stadium infrastructure caused by their supporters.[85] The side finished bottom of their group and was knocked out of European football altogether after two defeats in the final two matches.  
  With financial problems at the club ongoing, the summer of 2010 began for Rangers with several players leaving the club. With a limited transfer budget and a small squad, Smith had to decide whether to increase the number of playing staff or improve the starting eleven; he opted to sign Nikica Jelavić.[86]  
  Both sides of the Old Firm began the season with eight league wins in a row; however, with the sides meeting on matchday nine, something had to give. Rangers claimed a 3–1 victory over Celtic and took early control of the league. A 1–1 draw at home to Inverness the following weekend ended Rangers' 100% start to the season, and a home defeat by Hibernian inflicted the team's first league point-less match of the season, the first of five. The cold spell in the winter of 2010–11 saw many postponements, and for long spells Rangers were behind Celtic, albeit with games in hand. In the third league meeting between the Old Firm, Celtic came out on top and led the table for the first time that season; however, Celtic's advantage was short-lived, after a loss to Motherwell the following week[87] allowed Rangers to regain top spot. A 3–2 loss to Dundee United at Ibrox, followed by a goalless draw in the final Old Firm fixture, left the title in Celtic's hands with four matches remaining. There was to be a final twist in the league season, however. On 3 May, Celtic lost a rearranged match away to Inverness, and with three matches remaining, Rangers had a one-point lead. Smith's side went on to win all three fixtures, scoring eleven goals, and claimed the club's 54th league championship.[88]  
  In the domestic cup competitions, Rangers won the League Cup after beating Celtic 2–1 after extra time.[89] They lost 1–0 to Celtic in the fifth-round replay in Scottish Cup, however. The match was marked by several incidents: three Rangers players were sent off and Celtic manager Neil Lennon and Ally McCoist were involved in a pitch-side altercation at the final whistle.[90]  
  In Europe, Rangers automatically qualified for the UEFA Champions League group stages for the second season in a row. They drew Manchester United, Valencia and Bursaspor. Rangers were unbeaten in their first three group stage games, with a 0–0 draw at Old Trafford (the only team to keep a clean sheet at the Theatre of Dreams in the entire 2010–11 season), a 1–0 victory over Bursaspor at Ibrox and a 1–1 draw at home to Valencia. A 3–0 defeat in Valencia, followed by a 1–0 loss at home to Manchester United, ended Rangers' chances of qualifying for the last sixteen, but third place and a spot in the UEFA Europa League was already secured after Bursaspor failed to pick up a point in five games. In the last group match, Rangers drew 1–1 in Turkey, giving Bursaspor their first Champions League point. As a consolation, Rangers made it to the last sixteen of the Europa League, beating Sporting Lisbon on away goals in the last 32, but lost to PSV Eindhoven on aggregate.  
  On 6 May 2011, it was confirmed that David Murray had sold his controlling interest in the club (85.3%) for £1 to Wavetower Limited, a company owned by businessman Craig Whyte.[91]  
  McCoist's tenure, liquidation and relaunch (2011–2015)[edit]  
  Smith's deputy and Rangers record goalscorer Ally McCoist was appointed manager of the club for the 2011–12 season.[93] Hampered by a bizarre transfer policy under Whyte,[94] Rangers found themselves knocked out of first the UEFA Champions League and then the UEFA Europa League by the end of August, depriving the club of income that may have been anticipated. With the new ownership, there initially appeared to be some financial stability of the club. A number of first-team regulars were secured on long-term contract extensions, including Steven Davis,[95] Allan McGregor,[96] Steven Whittaker[96] and Gregg Wylde.[97] When McCoist entered the transfer market, his first signing being Almería midfielder Juan Manuel Ortiz,[98] he soon encountered difficulties. A number of highly publicised failed transfers, including deals for Wesley Verhoek and Roland Juhász, led to many doubting Craig Whyte's financial prowess.[99][100]  
  Rangers' first Scottish Premier League match of the season was a home match, against Jim Jefferies' Hearts, before which the league flag was unfurled by then-chairman Whyte. The following week, McCoist claimed his first competitive victory as manager with a win over his first club, St Johnstone.[101] The season proved to be a baptism of fire for McCoist; by early October, the club held a ten-point lead over Celtic,[102] and on 5 November the lead stood at fifteen points, and twelve over second-placed Motherwell.[103] A draw with St Johnstone and subsequent defeats to Kilmarnock,[104] St Mirren[105] and Celtic,[106] who then went on a run of twenty-one matches undefeated, saw Rangers slip to second place,[107] where the club remained for the rest of the season.  
  Rangers' European adventure began in the final week of July. They were defeated at home by underdogs Malmö 1-0[108] and crashed out of the Champions League with a 1–1 draw in Sweden in which both Steven Whittaker and Madjid Bougherra were both sent off.[109] In the Europa League play-off round, they were knocked out by NK Maribor.[110] In cup competitions, the club fared no better, with a third-round defeat by First Division side Falkirk in the League Cup[111] and a fifth-round exit at home to Dundee United.[112]  
  On 13 February 2012, Rangers filed legal papers at the Court of Session, giving notice of their intention to appoint administrators.[113] They officially entered administration the following day, and appointed London-based financial advisers Duff & Phelps as administrators.[113] They had entered administration over an alleged non-payment of £9 million in PAYE and VAT taxes to HM Revenue and Customs.[113][114] On entering administration, the team was docked ten points by the SPL, a move regarded as "effectively ending" its 2012 championship challenge.[113] A failure then to submit accounts for 2011 meant the club was not granted a licence to play in European football in season 2012–13.[115][116] In April, it was reported that the club's total debts could be as high as £134m.[117]  
  On 13 May, it was reported that Whyte had sold his controlling interest in The Rangers Football Club Plc for £2 to a consortium led by Charles Green.[118] Green offered the creditors a settlement, in the form of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), in an attempt to exit administration.[118] On 12 June, it emerged that HMRC would reject the CVA put forward by Green. Green's takeover of the club depended on the CVA being accepted by HMRC, which would have seen £8.5m of the total debt repaid. The formal rejection of the CVA, two days later, meant that The Rangers Football Club plc entered the liquidation process. The company's business and assets were sold to a company called Sevco Scotland Ltd, a consortium led by Green, in a deal worth £5.5m.[119] Sevco was subsequently renamed The Rangers Football Club Ltd at the end of July 2012.[120]  
  Ten of the other eleven SPL clubs voted against allowing Rangers to transfer their SPL membership share to a new company on 4 July, leaving the club applying for a place in the Scottish Football League.[121][122] On 13 July, 29 out of 30 SFL member clubs voted to give Rangers associate membership, but 25 of them also voted to place the club into the Third Division of the Scottish Football League from the start of the season.[123] Rangers clinched the Third Division title on 30 March after a goalless draw at Montrose, combined with a Queen's Park defeat.  
  Apart from being defeated 2–1 by Forfar in the first round of the League Cup on 3 August, season 2013–14 began with Rangers obtaining maximum points in their first fifteen games in League One.[124] 2014 was a mixed bag for the club: they reached the Ramsden's Cup Final, in which they were beaten by Raith Rovers. On 3 May, after a 1–1 draw with Dunfermline, Rangers players made history by becoming its first team in 115 years to go an entire league season unbeaten, finishing as Scottish League One champions.[125]  
  Rangers' boardroom politics were a fractious force, causing a constant flux with change after change of various directorial positions, rival factions attempting to take control of the company and the emergence of Mike Ashley as the majority stakeholder and power-broker in late 2014. That summer saw continued discontent with various fans groups, alongside Dave King, attempting to influence the board by withdrawing season-ticket money.[126] This resulted in a drop of around 15,000 season tickets from the previous season, leaving the club requiring a financial injection which the board hoped would come from a share issue[127] and announced this in June.[128] However, the initial intention of raising up to £10 million through an investment plan by the end of August failed when city investors did not purchase enough shares; therefore, the club relaunched a £4 million issue open to all existing shareholders only.[129]  
  Rangers fans' discontent was demonstrated during a Championship game against Queen of the South at Ibrox by their holding up red cards in the 18th and 72nd minutes.[130] This was followed on 3 September by a report that Mike Ashley had bought the naming rights to Ibrox Stadium for just £1 in a deal with Charles Green in 2012.[131][132] Concurrently, Rangers' former commercial director Imran Ahmad finally succeeded in a bid to have £620,000 of club assets frozen prior to pursuing litigation over an alleged unpaid £500,000 bonus.[133] A few days later, the club were granted leave to appeal this decision,[134] yet on 12 September, the club agreed to a settlement with Ahmad.[135] As some Rangers supporters groups considered boycotting home matches in protest at the board,[136] it was reported that Ashley would not be participating in the share offer.[137]  
  Ashley's motives for not investing became clear the following month with his withholding much-needed money from the club in order to undermine the board.[138] At the end of the share issue, on 12 September it was announced that it had raised just over £3 million, still £1 million short of its minimum target.[139] The share issue was undertaken in order to allow Rangers to continue to operate into the new year, but the failure to reach the targets meant that further funding was required. A few days later, it came to light that Sandy Easdale had met with several investors that had been introduced to him by Rafat Rizvi, a convicted fraudster wanted by Interpol,[140] which led to calls by the Union of Fans for Easdale to resign.[141] Easdale subsequently increased his personal shareholding at Rangers to 5.21% on 24 September.[142] On the same day, the club repaid the £1.5 million loan to Sandy Easdale and George Letham.[143] The next day, BNP Paribas bought a 5% stake in Rangers, making it the fifth-largest shareholder.[144] Less than 24 hours later, however, it was reported that the transaction was completed on Ashley's behalf, thus increasing his stake to 8.92%.[145] A few days later, Ashley's holding company, MASH Holdings, called for an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to remove chief executive Wallace.[138] This signalled the start of a crucial stage in the boardroom power struggle at Rangers, with King appearing to be outflanked[146] by Ashley, who had secured the support of Sandy Easdale, David Sommers, as well as the largest shareholder in Rangers, Laxey Partners.[138]  
  When offers of funding from Dave King, a £16 million package, and Brian Kennedy were rejected by Rangers' hierarchy,[147] who instead opted Mike Ashley's £2 million loan offer,[148] it was clear who was victorious. Particularly as Ashley's initial offer was insufficient and he had to be provide another £1 million of funding less than a month later.[149] In exchange for the initial funding, Ashley was granted critical power at the club with the privilege to put forward the names of two nominees for appointment to the board as well as security over Edmiston House and Albion Car Park.[150] As a consequence of his power gain, both Philip Nash and Graham Wallace were forced out of the club[151] and Derek Llambias and Barry Leach were brought in, initially as consultants,[152] before being appointed chief executive[153] and finance director,[154] respectively. Also, David Somers was named executive chairman, on a temporary basis, in order to aid the transition.[155] Financial respite was short-lived as Rangers announced its preliminary results at the end of November, indicating the club required another £8m of investment to see out the season.[156] This effectively left Rangers at the mercy of Ashley, who could dictate the terms of and source of any future funding. Due to this power, the Scottish Football Association issued Ashley with a notice of complaint for breached a joint agreement that Ashley would not play a controlling role in Rangers and would maintain a stake of no more than 10%.[157] Although Ashley had previously loaned the club £2 million[148] and a further £1 million,[149] as well as having two directors on the Rangers board and a significant interest in Rangers retail operations, he did return the naming rights to Ibrox Stadium to Rangers.[149] On Christmas Eve, the SFA denied him permission to increase his stakehold in Rangers further.[158] Also in December, the Scottish Professional Football League added to Rangers' financial woes by withholding £250,000 of broadcast money the club was due in a bid to recoup a fine imposed by the Nimmo Smith Commission.[159]  
  The legal implications of the previous company that owned the club's liquidation featured prevalently in the news in July and November. In the summer, HM Revenue and Customs lost its appeal over the previous club's owners use of employee benefit trusts[160] but was granted leave to appeal a month later.[161] Meanwhile, Rangers former chairman Craig Whyte was banned from being a company director for fifteen years in September[162] and a warrant was issued for his arrest a month later.[163] He appeared in court, facing charges under the Companies Act, but was released on bail.[164] Four men have appeared in court charged with fraudulent activity following a probe into the sale of Rangers in 2011. David Grier, Paul Clark and David Whitehouse (both administrators working for Duff & Phelps) and Gary Withey (a former solicitor for Collyer Bristow) made no plea or declaration at Glasgow Sheriff Court and were granted bail.[165] Meanwhile, the liquidators of Rangers former owners secured a £24 million payment from Collyer Bristow, the law firm that acted for Whyte when he bought the club.[166]  
  On the football front, Rangers' league campaign began with a defeat to newly relegated Hearts, with the Edinburgh club scoring an injury-time winner.[167] Despite embarking on a nine-game unbeaten run in all competitions, a loss at home to Hibernian left Rangers trailing leaders Hearts by six points at the end of September.[168] Better news for Rangers was the reaching of the League Cup semi-final after a 1–0 win over St Johnstone.[169] They were drawn against Celtic, setting up the first Old Firm derby in two years.[170] Nevertheless, the club's title charge was effectively ended in November as the side lost a six-pointer match away to league leaders Hearts leaving them nine points behind.[171] The did bounce back the following week in the Scottish Cup registering a 3–0 win over Premiership side Kilmarnock,[172] however, in the club's third cup competition the team surrendered a 2–0 lead to lose 3–2 to fellow Championship team Alloa Athletic in the Challenge Cup.[173] Even with the poor league form and exit in the Challenge Cup, there was no indication of significant pressure on manager Ally McCoist. The effect of the club's financial issues, as underlined by the interim results that November, proved the catalyst for McCoist's departure as he became unhappy with the number of staff losing their jobs at Rangers.[174] The situation became too much for McCoist, and he tendered his resignation on 12 December[175] which was later confirmed to the London Stock Exchange by the club three days later, with McCoist beginning a twelve-month notice period;[176] however, McCoist served less than a week of his notice period before being placed on gardening leave by the board, with his assistant manager Kenny McDowall being appointed interim manager until the end of the season.[177]  
  Boardroom changes and return to the top flight (2015–2021)[edit]  
  The start of 2015 saw Mike Ashley's control over Rangers weakened as deals were made with a consortium, led by Dave King, to purchase the shareholding of Laxey Partners which had stood at 16%.[178] King took control of a 14.57% stake[179] and two weeks later called for an EGM on 16 January.[180] The original date was set by the board was 4 March in a hotel in London;[181] however, this was then moved to Ibrox Stadium, after two successive hotels refused to host the event,[182] with a date of 6 March.[183] During the run-up to the EGM, the incumbent Rangers board agreed £10m funding deal with Sports Direct.[184] The agreement saw Sports Direct hold a floating charge over Murray Park, Edmiston House, Albion Car Park and the club's registered trademarks. Sports Direct was also transferred 26% of Rangers' share in Rangers Retail Limited (Rangers previously held 51%, with Sports Direct holding the balance). The club were bound to forego all shirt sponsorship revenue for the 2016–17 season and subsequent seasons until the loan was repaid.[185] On transfer deadline day, Rangers were loaned five players from Newcastle United, a Premier League club that Ashley owns.[186]  
  February saw a large volume of share purchases, and Rangers supporters groups were heavily involved.[187] With the writing apparently on the wall, Rangers director James Easdale resigned just over a week before the EGM[188] and chairman Somers departed with fours days to go.[189] The SFA's investigation into Ashley concluded at the beginning of March that Ashley was deemed to have broken rules on dual ownership due to his influence on the affairs of Rangers. He was fined £7,500,[190] and Rangers were subsequently fined £5,500 over a month later for their lack of governance.[191] Just two days before the EGM, the club's nominated adviser, WH Ireland, resigned, resulting shares in the plc being suspended.[192] The outcome of the EGM was a decisive victory for King's consortium, with Derek Llambias and finance director Barry Leach being voted off the board, replaced by King, Paul Murray and John Giligan.[193] Both King and Murray subsequently applied to be passed as a fit and proper person by the SFA, with the later being cleared at the beginning of May.[194] Further board appointments were made, with John Bennett and Chris Graham added to the plc board as non-executive directors. James Blair was appointed company secretary.[195] Graham resigned his directorship three days later.[196] On the same day as the appointments, Rangers suspended Llambias, Leach and Sandy Easdale from its football club board pending an internal investigation.[195]  
  After poor results in both the league and Scottish Cup, Stuart McCall replaced Kenny McDowall as interim manager.[197] At the end of March, it was revealed that five loan signings from Newcastle United were signed without medicals.[198] On same day as interim accounts were published, 31 March, it emerged that Rangers would have owed Newcastle United £500,000 if they were promoted due to the agreement struck when loaning the players.[199] It was announced on 2 April that Rangers would be de-listed from the Alternative Investment Market stock exchange after failing to find a nominated adviser within the required period.[200] The SPFL courted controversy with the final-day fixtures by moving the Rangers v. Hearts match from Saturday to Sunday, with the rest of the matches proceeding on the Saturday. This could have given Rangers a possible advantage in the chase for second place. The SPFL performed a U-turn, with all matches being scheduled for early Saturday afternoon.[201] As it transpired, the team failed to be automatically promoted to the Premiership, drawing the final two league matches and finishing third in the league.[202] This meant the club faced at least six play-off matches in order to gain promotion. The ticket pricing of these matches attracted controversy. Following a precedent set by Hibernian the previous season, Rangers stated they would allow season ticket holders entry to home matches for free; however, this was rejected by the SPFL.[203] Rangers then announced a blanket £5 ticket price offer for all seats.[204] The side successfully negotiated two play-off rounds before falling to a 6–1 aggregate defeat to Premiership team Motherwell.[205] The second leg of the play-off final ended in controversy as Rangers' Bilel Mohsni and Motherwell's Lee Erwin brawled on the pitch after the match[206] as Motherwell fans invaded the pitch to goad the Rangers fans.[205]  
  The police probed the role of Mike Ashley and Sports Direct in the Rangers takeover and searched the company's headquarters.[207] This was rumoured to be the reason that Ashley demanded the repayment of his £5m loan to the club.[208] Rangers set the date of the general meeting for June 2015 and added its own resolutions and proposals.[209] On 19 May, King was passed fit and proper by the SFA[210] and became chairman of the club on 22 May.[211] On the same day, King also loaned the club an additional £1.5m.[212] A day later, former Rangers player John Greig was named honorary president of the club.[213]  
  In early June, Ibrox Stadium played host to the company's second EGM in just over three months.[214] A majority of shareholders voted in favour of a board resolution to renegotiate existing retail agreements with Sports Direct and voted against the early repayment of a loan from Mike Ashley.[215] Rangers made further appointments to the board, with Stewart Robertson joining as managing director and Andrew Dickinson being promoted to financial director.[216]  
  The spectre of the previous board loomed large at the beginning of the season as Police Scotland's investigation into the sale of Rangers' assets to a consortium led by Charles Green led to arrests and seven indictments. On 1 September, both Craig Whyte and Green were arrested as part of the inquiry into the "alleged fraudulent acquisition" of Rangers' assets in 2012.[217] Just over two weeks later, indictments were served on seven accused, including Green and Whyte, David Whitehouse, Paul Clark, David Grier (who were all working for administrators Duff and Phelps at the time), Gary Withey (who worked for a law firm involved in the purchase of Rangers by Whyte) and Imran Ahmad, a former Rangers commercial director.[218] Indeed, the latter indicated that he would not co-operate with the proceedings;[219] subsequently a warrant was issued for his arrest[220] and charges against him were temporarily stopped.[221] A week later, Green took the company to the Court of Session in an attempt to force the PLC to pay his legal fees with regards to the forthcoming trial;[222] however, the action was dismissed by Lord Doherty a few months later[223] and an appeal to the Inner House was also refused in March 2016.[224]  
  On 30 October 2015, Rangers announced it was not appropriate to proceed with a share issue and listing on the ISDX market until the criminal proceedings being brought against Charles Green, Imran Ahmed, Craig Whyte and others was concluded.[225] On 5 February 2016, prosecutors withdrew six of fifteen charges brought against the six men in the alleged Rangers fraud case,[226] which resulted in all charges against Duff and Phelps administrators David Whitehouse and Paul Clark being dropped, although prosecutors indicated there would be filing fresh charges against the pair.[227] Charges against Green were also dropped, meaning that the former chief executive of the club was not facing any.[228] A few months later, in May 2016, it was announced that charges against Gary Withey and David Grier were dropped and that they would not stand trial alongside former Rangers owner Craig Whyte, the only person still facing charges.[229]  
  On 4 November 2015, the club's PLC owner, Rangers International Football Club, announced a loss of £7.5m for the year ending June 2015.[230] This meant the company was required to find approximately £2.5m in order to cover expenses for the rest of the season.[230] Moreover, the outcome of HMRC's appeal against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal regarding the previous owner and its use of EBT's. The Court of Session ruled that the use of employee benefit trusts broke tax rules; therefore, the payments were eligible for tax deductions,[231] although an appeal to the Supreme Court was sought less than a month later[232] and granted in March 2016.[233] This judgement caused debate in Scottish football as many people erroneously believed the decision made by the Nimmo Smith commission not to strip Rangers of titles was based on the outcome of the tax case.[234] Coincidentally, the commission's ruling was taken to an arbitration tribunal by the club's owners with RIFC PLC disputing its liability for the £250,000 fine plus £150,000 in additional costs, imposed on the company that previous owned the club. The SPFL subsequently imposed this on the new owners of the club as part of the terms of the five-way agreement.[235] An independent SFA tribunal ruled that RIFC PLC was liable for the fine in March 2016.[236]  
  Further legal matters occurred a week later, although not directly involving Rangers, as Mike Ashley lodged a challenge to the SFA's decision to pass King as a fit and proper person by seeking a Judicial review;[237] however, the litigation was abandoned in April 2016 after his legal team received information about King's finances which the SFA used in their fit and proper deliberations.[238] Ashley had also raised court proceedings against Dave King, accusing him of breaching a court injunction regarding the commercial agreements between Rangers and Sports Direct; however, the Royal Courts of Justice dismissed the motion for him to be jailed.[239] A further accusation that King committed contempt of court was also dismissed.[240] In the end, the court action against King was discontinued by Sports Direct as the company halted litigation, claiming a breach of confidentiality, in relation to a commercial deal, which the judge called "ridiculous".[241]  
  The end of November saw the PLC's annual general meeting; however, prior to this, Mike Ashley continued with his ligation against the company and successfully managed to have Resolution 11 withdrawn which would have allowed shareholders to block the voting rights of dual ownership shareholders.[242] The AGM passed without major incident; however, chairman Dave King announced the adoption of the living wage for company employees and the repayment of a £5m loan from Ashley's Sports Direct.[243] Although, on 11 December, it was reported that the company had not repaid the £5m loan despite earlier claims to the contrary.[244] On Christmas Eve, Rangers announced that the loan had been repaid to Ashley in full[245] and it was later revealed, on Ne'erday, that Rangers had borrowed £6.5m from King and others in order to do this.[246] On 4 February, it was announced by the Rangers board that they had given Sports Direct formal notice that they wish to end their retail deal for club merchandise.[247] On 18 May, Rangers indicated its intention to end the joint venture with Sports Direct for selling club kits and merchandise. This included the withdrawal of the rights to use club trademarks.[248]  
  On the football front, Rangers appointed its fourteenth permanent manager on 15 June in the shape of Mark Warburton, who agreed a three-year contract.[249] Warburton was joined at the club by former Rangers centre-back David Weir, who became his assistant manager. The start to the season saw Rangers embark on a run of eleven straight victories in all competitions. This helped Warburton overtake former Rangers manager Bill Struth's record of eight consecutive wins by a manager at the beginning of their Ibrox career.[250] Ultimately, this would could not continue: the series of victories came to an abrupt halt in mid-September as the club suffered a 3–1 defeat to St Johnstone in the League Cup.[251] Despite this, Rangers continuing a winning steak for the first eleven games of the league season which gave the club an eight-point lead over second-placed Hibernian at the top of the table by late October.[252] Eight points were picked up from a possible eighteen over the next six league games, including two defeats to Hibernian[253] and Falkirk.[254] This left Rangers tied with the Edinburgh club on forty-one points ahead of crucial match between the two during the festive period. Rangers played Hibernian on 28 December at Ibrox, beating Alan Stubbs' side 4–2.[255] They then embarked on an unbeaten run of ten matches, winning nine, with only Alloa Athletic managing to take points off them.[256] Alongside this rich vein of form, second-placed Hibs suffered a run of three defeats within a week to see them trail Rangers at the top of the table by fourteen points as the season entered March.[257]  
  The league crown was secured for Rangers on 5 April at Ibrox[258] and formed the first part of a brace of trophies within a week. The team qualified for its second Challenge Cup Final in the space of three years with the match being played at Hampden Park for the first time in the competition's history.[259] The match was played in front of a near sell-out as Rangers ran out 4–0 winners over Scottish League One side Peterhead on 10 April.[260] Similarly, in the Scottish Cup, the club reached its second semi-final in three seasons, setting up the first Old Firm derby in over a year.[261] A highly anticipated match ended with both sides tied after full and extra time with Rangers winning the penalty shoot-out to progress to the final.[262] The semi-final heroics were ultimately for nothing as Rangers lost the 2016 Scottish Cup Final to Hibernian with the Edinburgh club scoring an injury-time winner.[263] However, their victory was marred by a pitch invasion by Hibs fans at the final whistle.[264] The SFA has said it is "appalled" by scenes of disorder[265] and set up a commission to review operational failings apparent from the day.[266] Police Scotland also investigated the events,[267] which included assaults on Rangers players and staff.[268]  
  The club's pre-season plans were confirmed in May with the first team's squad travelling to the United States for a training camp which incorporated a friendly match against United Soccer League side Charleston Battery.[270] The fallout from the 2016 Scottish Cup Final fan violence continued with the SFA announcing a former Sheriff principal would chair the independent commission into the disorder.[267][271] The commission reported on 5 August and concluded the pitch invasion was sparked by the high excitement of Hibernian fans, yet neither club could be blamed. The report highlighted security plans were appropriate and that the Scottish Government should consider criminalising pitch invasions.[272] However, Rangers raised concerns about several factual inaccuracies and contradictions in the report and asked to discuss this with the SFA.[273]  
  On 30 August 2016, Rangers and Hibernian were issued with notices of complaint by the Scottish FA's compliance officer in relation to the Scottish Cup Final.[274] The end of May saw Rangers continue preparations for the forthcoming season with the signing of English Championship winner Joey Barton from Burnley, Liverpool youth player Jordan Rossiter[275] and former Tottenham Hotspur playmaker Niko Kranjčar. Rangers managing director Stewart Robertson also disclosed that manager Mark Warburton and his assistant David Weir were negotiating new contracts,[276] with the pair agreeing one-year extensions on 12 July. Warburton went on to bring in eleven new players in total,[277] including paying a million-pound-plus transfer fee for Englishman Joe Garner which represented the largest investment made by Rangers in a player for over five years, since the signing of former club captain Lee Wallace in July 2011.[278]  
  In June 2016, it was announced by the SPFL that the Challenge Cup would be expanded to include teams from the Welsh Premier League, Northern Irish Premiership and an under-20s side from each Scottish Premiership club.[279] On the same day as this announcement, the under-20s team coach Ian Durrant was relieved of his duties in a coaching reshuffle,[280] with Rangers appointing Graeme Murty as Head Development Squad Coach on 17 August to replace him.[281] The draw for the first round of the 2016–17 Challenge Cup was made, with Rangers' under-20s side paired with Lowland Football League side Stirling University F.C.[282] The U-20 side progressed by beating Stirling University 4–0 at Forthbank Stadium, with Josh Jeffries scoring twice.[283] A second-round tie with Scottish League One side Stenhousemuir was set up,[284] again played at Forthbank; however, the side could not match its previous performance and went down 3–1, with Ryan Hardie netting the Rangers goal.[285]  
  The senior side began the season in mid-July as part of the new-look League Cup format,[286] paired in a group with Motherwell, Annan Athletic, East Stirlingshire and Stranraer.[287] The season got off to a winning start as the side beat Motherwell[288] and Annan Athletic.[289] After topping their group[290] and strong showings in the two subsequent rounds,[291][292] Rangers set up a semi-final against Celtic;[293] however, the side lost 1–0, which ended their participation in the competition.[294] The side's league form proved equally fruitless as they engaged in a faulting start to the season which culminated in a 5–1 defeat to Celtic.[295] The opening league match of the season saw Rangers stutter to a 1–1 draw at home to Hamilton Academical[296] and despite registering wins in the following two matches Rangers went through the month of September without winning a league match, including defeats to both Aberdeen[297] and Celtic.[295] The aftermath from the latter match saw Rangers suspend midfielder Joey Barton for three weeks.[298] He had been involved in a training-ground bust-up with fellow midfielder Andy Halliday a few days after losing to Celtic.[299] The suspension was extended by another week on 9 October[300] and Barton was also charged by the Scottish Football Association for breaking rules relating to gambling on football matches.[301]  
  Upon the completion of his suspension, Barton returned to Ibrox for a meeting on 27 October; however, upon its conclusion it emerged that he remained suspended by the club, and no party made further comment.[302] In the meantime, despite the first-team's indifferent league form, the side still sat second in the Premiership by the end of October,[303] even though two of the marquee summer signings had effectively been ruled out for the season, with Barton returning from suspension but being relegated to the youth team[304] and Niko Kranjčar suffering cruciate ligament injury, which sidelined him for the rest of the season.[305] Barton was unhappy at being relegated to the youth team and was signed off with stress on 8 November,[306] but the saga came to a conclusion two days later when the Englishman mutually agreed to a contract termination.  
  The side's form improved through December, with a four-match winning run on the back of a 2–0 defeat to Hearts at Tynecastle on 30 November.[307] The final two matches of 2016 saw the side collect one point from a possible six, with a draw at St Johnstone[308] and defeat in the third Old Firm derby of the season.[309] This left the club second in the table going into 2017 and the mid-season break, two points ahead of third-placed Aberdeen, although the Dons had a game in hand. The January transfer window saw the club released several former youth prospects who had failed to meet expectations, while Mark Warburton brought in two young loanee signings from English Premier League sides in the shape of Emerson Hyndman and Jon Toral from AFC Bournemouth and Arsenal, respectively. However, the lack of any permanent outfield signings drew criticism, as did the performances of the previous summer's transfers, with particular focus being placed on the role of Head of Recruitment Frank McParland.[310]  
  On 10 February 2017, manager Warburton, assistant manager David Weir and McParland left Rangers. Graeme Murty was placed in caretaker control of the first team.[311][312] Several reasons for the trio's departure were highlighted by the media, as well as the club. The first team's poor performance in the first half of the season a prominent cause, which crystallised after a 4–1 defeat at Hearts on 1 February[313] and a 1–1 draw at home to Ross County three days later, a match which proved to be Warburton's last game in charge.[314] The poor signing policy was mooted;[315] however, the club also stated that the management team were not committed to the job and reported the team had tendered their resignations five days before being replaced,[312][316] which Warburton later disputed.[317] Early contenders for the role included former Rangers manager Alex McLeish[318] and former Rangers defender Frank de Boer.[319] On 14 February 2017, managing director Stewart Robertson announced that the club would seek to appoint a Director of Football to work alongside a new first-team manager.[320]  
  Graeme Murty's time in charge began with a fourth-round Scottish Cup win over Greenock Morton; however, league formed remained indifferent, for his first two league matches ende in defeats at Dundee[321] and Inverness.[322] This left the side in third place, six points adrift of Aberdeen, at the beginning of March. A dramatic 3–2 win of St Johnstone saw Murty register his only league win in his six-game spell as manager, with his last two games in charge seeing him set up to a Scottish Cup semi-final against Celtic after a 6–0 win over Hamilton Academical, the team's largest win of the season, before drawing the third league Old Firm match. On 11 March, Rangers confirmed Pedro Caixinha as the club's sixteenth manager with the Portuguese coach appointed two days later.[323] The pursuit of a Director of Football was not as successful as the board's first choice, Southampton's Ross Wilson,[324] turned down the offer of the role.[325]  
  Away from football, the board instigated court proceedings against four of its former executives and investor Mike Ashley. The case against former chief executives Charles Green and Derek Llambias, former commercial director Imran Ahmad, former financial director Brian Stockbridge and Ashley was brought regarding a loss of income caused by retail deals agreed between the company that owns the club and Sports Direct from 2012 to 2015.[326] Details of Rangers' legal claim was revealed on 12 August after Ashley's lawyers succeeded in a bid to have the documents disclosed. According to the papers lodged with the Court of Session, Rangers sought approximately £4.1m in damages caused by alleged negligence by Green and other club staff from which Ashley unfairly benefited.[327] Rangers regained representation at a domestic football level as managing director Stewart Robertson was appointed to the SFA board, although he had initially signalled his intent to stand for the SPFL board but withdrew due to a lack of support.[328] Meanwhile, the former Rangers owner Craig Whyte was the only person facing fraud charges relating to the liquidation of The Rangers Football Club Plc proceedings begun in June.[329] In a bizarre twist, former Rangers vice-chairman Donald Findlay was appointed to Whyte's legal team and defended Whyte when he faced charges relating to the acquisition of the club in May 2011 and its subsequent financial mismanagement.[330] On 22 December, at his pre-trial Whyte entered a not-guilty plea at the High Court in Glasgow.[331] The trial concerning accusations of fraudulent acquisition of the club began in April 2017, with former Rangers managers Walter Smith and Ally McCoist called to give evidence about the financial situation at the club preceding Whyte's reign.[332]  
  The corporate aftermath of Whyte's reign was continued and it was revealed that club administrators had raised legal action against Police Scotland and the Lord Advocate[333] while creditors would receive £2m less in potential payouts after the liquidation costs increased, leaving the total payout at £16.663m.[334] Although RIFC did settle a fine imposed upon the club by the Nimmo Smith commission[335] after a tribunal held against the club in October 2015, the total cost was £286,000.[336] At the start of February, it was reported that liquidators of the old company, BDO, had launched a legal action against former administrators Duff & Phelps over the business strategies adopted by the administrating team and seeking up to £28.9m in damages.[337]  
  The spectre of Mike Ashley continued to haunt Rangers in the early part of the season. He lost a legal challenge to the SFA's fine over breaching dual ownership rules[338] with reports he faced a £250,000 legal bill.[339] In October, he was ordered to pay half of the SFA's legal costs and an additional fee for the costs incurred from receiving specialist legal advice.[340] Moreover, further failed legal action meant Ashley was required to pay the legal costs of the SFA and Dave King following a failed bid to overturn the decision that King was a "fit and proper" person from April 2016.[341] Despite standing down from the board of Rangers Retail in June 2016, the club's joint merchandising venture with Sports Direct,[342] Ashley refused to relinquish his grip over Rangers retail operations.[343][344] After reaching an impasse in its attempts to renegotiate the retail agreements with Sports Direct, a stand-off ensued between the retailer and Rangers, with the latter withdrew removing rights to use the club's intellectual property which would impact on the sale of Rangers new Puma football kits.[345] Despite the club withdrawing permission to use its trademarks, which effectively halted the sale of kits,[346] Puma released the 2016–17 kits at the beginning of August.[347] This led to the board to consider replacing the Puma kits with an alternative.[348] The contract with Rangers Retail reportedly earned the club only four pence from every pound spent on merchandise and was highlighted as a reason for Rangers' weak financial performance. On 31 October 2016 it emerged that Ashley lodged a counter-suit against Rangers, King and director Paul Murray,[349] with initial proceedings regarding the case being heard at the High Court of Justice in March 2017.[350]  
  The board released RIFC's annual accounts on 28 October which revealed annual losses had been halved to £3.3m and turnover increased to £22.2m; however, further funding was required to maintain the business as a going concern.[351] In March 2017, following a complaint by former Rangers chairman David Somers, the Takeover Appeal Board ruled that Dave King had been acting in concert with other investors during King's March 2015 boardroom takeover. This meant that King was liable to purchase all of the shares in RIFC, with the TAB setting a price of 20p per share.[352] A few days later, RIFC revealed an operating profit of £300,000 in unaudited results for the six months to 31 December 2016, although this equated to a pre-tax loss of £278,000.[353]  
  Rangers fan groups Rangers Supporters' Trust, Rangers Supporters Assembly and Rangers First merged to form Club 1872 in late May,[354] and two weeks later it announced that the new organisation had purchased enough shares to make it the sixth-largest shareholder in RIFC.[355] Harmony did not last for long amongst the support, however, as three directors of the Rangers First resigned from the organisation over a row regarding its governance, with Rangers First now the shareholding vehicle for Club 1872.[356] On 30 September, the results of the first elections to Club 1872's board was announced, with seven members elected including Rangers current company secretary James Blair, former requisitioner Alex Wilson, as well as the leader of Sons of Struth Craig Houston.[357] In November, the fans' group increased its holding further to become the fifth-largest individual shareholder, possessing just over five million ordinary shares;[358] however, further setbacks saw three directors resign from the board of Club 1872 after only six months in their post.[359]  
  Rangers exited the Europa League in the first qualifying round, losing 2–1 on aggregate to FC Progrès Niederkorn. An indifferent start to the league campaign followed, with two defeats in their first seven games, compounded with a defeat at home to Motherwell in the semi-finals of the League Cup on 22 October. Pedro Caixinha was relieved of his duties four days later.[360] Graeme Murty was installed as caretaker manager again.[361] Rangers finished third in the Premiership, twelve points behind champions Celtic. They had exited the Scottish Cup at the semi-finals stage to Celtic, who went on to win the competition. Murty was sacked on 1 May, replaced in an interim capacity by his assistant Jimmy Nicholl and Jonatan Johansson.[362] In the transfer market, Ryan Jack had arrived on a free transfer from Aberdeen.[363] Colombian striker Alfredo Morelos joined, for an undisclosed fee, from HJK Helsinki.[364] He was the club's joint-top-scorer in all competitions, with eighteen goals, alongside Josh Windass. Out had gone midfielder Billy Gilmour to Chelsea, again for an undisclosed amount.[365]  
  Rangers finished second in the Premiership, nine points behind champions Celtic, who completed an unprecedent treble treble.[373] The club fell at the quarter-finals stage of the Scottish Cup. They went one better in the League Cup. After navigating the qualification stage of the Europa League, Rangers finished third behind Villarreal and Rapid Wien and failed to advance to the knockout phase.[374]  
  Alfredo Morelos finished as the club's top scorer again, with thirty goals to his name.  
  Steven Gerrard's second season began with the permanent signing of Steven Davis after his contract with Southampton expired.[375] Also joining was Nigerian midfielder Joe Aribo from Charlton Athletic.[376] Ryan Kent also made permanent his move from Liverpool to Ibrox for an undisclosed fee.[377]  
  After an unbeaten pre-season, Rangers won the first three league fixtures, but lost out, 2–0 at home, in the first Old Firm derby of the campaign. Celtic continued to hold off their city rivals for the remainder of the season and claimed their ninth league title in a row by a thirteen-point margin.[378] Celtic also beat them in the Scottish League Cup Final,[379] while they were knocked out of the Scottish Cup quarter-finals by Hearts.[380]  
  Rangers again made it through the Europa League qualifiers, and this time advanced to the knockout phase after finishing as runners-up behind Porto in Group G.[381] They were eliminated by Bayer Leverkusen in the round of 16.[382]  
  Alfredo Morelos made it three consecutive seasons as the club's leading scorer, this time with 29.  
  Rangers finished the league season unbeaten (including a fifteen-game winning streak) to prevent Celtic from achieving the coveted ten-in-a-row[387] as they finished on 102 points, twenty-five ahead of their city rivals. It was Steven Gerrard's first piece of silverware in his three years at Ibrox.[388] The club also reached the quarter-finals of both domestic cup competitions, which were both won by St Johnstone.  
  The club qualified for the Europa League group stage for the third-straight season. This time, they won their group, beating Benfice by two points. They again made it to the round of 16, in which they lost to 3–1 on aggregate to SK Slavia Prague. They had two players sent off in the second leg at Ibrox.[389]  
  An injury to Alfredo Morelos kept him out of the goalscoring table. Club captain James Tavernier scored nineteen goals in all competitions to take the accolade.  
  Steven Gerrard was tempted back to England to become the manager of Aston Villa in November.[390] Rangers received compensation of around £4 million to release him from his contract.[391]  
  A few weeks prior to Gerrard's departure, Walter Smith, twice manager of Rangers, died at the age of 73. He guided Rangers to the championship on ten occasions, as well as enjoying five Scottish Cup Final victories and six in the League Cup.[392]  
  Former Rangers midfielder, Dutchman Giovanni van Bronckhorst, was hired as Gerrard's successor eleven days later. He became the eighteenth manager of the club.  
  Rangers finished second in the Premiership, four points behind Celtic, now managed by Australian Ange Postecoglou.  
  The club reached the final of the Europa League, losing 5–4 on penalties, after extra time, to Eintracht Frankfurt.[396]  
  They were knocked out of the League Cup by Hibs in the semi-finals,[397] but they won the Scottish Cup, beating Hearts 2–0 after extra time, giving van Bronckhorst silverware in his first season and Rangers their 34th success in the competition, but their first in thirteen years.[398]

  Chennaiyin's Bijay Chhetri creates history; signs for Latin American Colon Futbol Club  
  Bijay Chhetri thanked Chennaiyin management along with his agency.  
  Rising Indian footballer Bijay Chhetri has completed his move to Colon Futbol Club, Uruguay from Chennaiyin FC. It is a loan until the end of the year with Colon Futbol Club retaining the option to make the signing permanent. With this, he became the first Indian footballer to sign a professional contract with a Latin American club.  
  Colon Futbol Club is a 116-year-old professional football club based in Montevideo and currently competing in the second division of Uruguay.  
  Chennaiyin FC co-owner Vita Dani expressed her happiness on the Bijay’s move. She commented: “We are extremely proud to see Bijay make his way to one of the world’s biggest football nations. Uruguay are forever etched in the game’s history, with four stars on their chest as winners of two Olympic gold medals in 1924 and 1928, the first World Cup in 1930 and then repeating in Brazil in 1950.  
  And Colon Futbol Club are part of that heritage; founded even before the first World Cup. I wish Bijay the very best and we are all hoping for his success as he makes history as the first Indian player to secure a contract with a Latin American club.”  
  Marcelo Rifas, director of Colon Futbol Club, speaking on the transfer said, “When a Bijay’s profile was proposed to us, looking at his videos from the past, his profile and our internal references we got more and more confident of the player. Now we sincerely hope he can come at the earliest and get integrated into our team. We see him as a solid first team player for us. It also helps us open a line of sourcing players from a new marketplace.”  
  As part of their commitment towards nurturing and developing young Indian talent, the two-time ISL champions Chennaiyin roped in Chhetri in July last year and since then the talented 22-year-old defender from Manipur has been training and honing his skills under the expert coaches of the club.  
  “I feel so excited to get this opportunity for the new challenge in my professional career. I hope to put in good performances to enhance my game, repay the trust shown in me by Colon FC and to keep the Indian flag flying high. I am very well aware that If I do well it can pave the way for future Indian players also to move abroad into these markets.  
  “I wish to sincerely thank Vita Dani and the Chennaiyin FC management along with my agency Soccer Consultants Group for facilitating the transfer. Without their help it wouldn’t have been possible,” Chhetri expressed.  
  Jose Mourinho next club odds as Chelsea, Newcastle and Napoli rival Bayern Munich swoop  
  Jose Mourinho has been heavily linked with a sensational return to Chelsea recently as Mauricio Pochettino struggles to impress

  It has been revealed who the bookies' favourite is to appoint Jose Mourinho as manager this summer. The former Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur boss left Roma in January after two-and-a-half-years in the Italian capital.  
  Mourinho had led the club to Europa Conference League glory during his debut campaign before securing a place in the Europa League final the following season. Despite reigniting the Stadio Olimpico, a handful of poor results over the festive cost him his job.  
  Since, Mourinho has been heavily linked with numerous positions in Europe and the Middle East – one of which being a return to Stamford Bridge, with Mauricio Pochettino struggling to impress in west London. With that being said, the 61-year-old tactician was quizzed on his future over the weekend.  
  Speaking to reporters while attending the Portuguese Motorcycle Grand Prix, Mourinho revealed that he wants to return to management this summer. He said: "Zero news. I don't have a club, I'm free. But I want to work, in the summer I want to work. Never say no, especially in football. My life is football. I can train anywhere and I have no problems."  
  For now, it remains to be seen where Mourinho will take his talents next, but Betfair have backed Napoli as the 5/1 favourites to secure his signature. The former Real Madrid boss has previously heaped tremendous praise on Victor Osimhen, comparing the Nigeria international to Didier Drogba.  
  Meanwhile, Chelsea have been tipped just as like as Newcastle to appoint Mourinho at 6/1. Mourinho has previously enjoyed two fruitful spells at Stamford Bridge, though both of which came during Roman Abramovich's reign.  
  Betfair have priced Marseille at 9/1 and Bayern Munich at 10/1. Earlier this year, the Bundesliga champions confirmed that Thomas Tuchel has agreed to leave the Allianz Arena at the end of the season with Bayer Leverkusen set to end their 11-year dominance in the German top flight.  
  And finally, Betfair have backed Mourinho to replace Roberto Martinez as Portugal head coach ahead of the European Championships at 12/1. Following the Portuguese tactician's departure from Roma at the start of the year, Rio Ferdinand admitted he'd 'love' to see him back at Chelsea.  
  "To Chelsea? Mourinho? No chance," the former Manchester United defender said on the Vibe with Five podcast. "These guys, these Americans [Chelsea’s owners] don’t go backwards like that. Not backwards in talent or class… they’re not going backwards and getting [a former manager].  
  "I would love to see Jose back there, I’ve got to be honest. Me, personally, Jose, please, I hope you get the job if [Mauricio] Pochettino doesn’t do well. I think they’re gonna stay with Pochettino."  
  Ferdinand added: "If he doesn’t go Chelsea, where’s he go? Newcastle? I would love to see him there. But Eddie Howe, man, he’s been unreal. I wouldn’t want to see Eddie go. I don’t think the FA [would] hire a Jose Mourinho. I would.  
  "But I don’t think the FA… they’re not going from Gareth Southgate to Mourinho. That’s too big of a difference in character and personality. It’s not happening. [That’s like going from] ready salted to vindaloo, bruv. It’s not happening."

  Kepa Arrizabalaga: Why the most expensive goalkeeper of all time is once again Chelsea's No 1  
  Kepa Arrizabalaga has started Chelsea's last eight matches; 'keeper hoping to record sixth successive clean sheet against Man Utd this weekend; watch Chelsea vs Man Utd on Saturday, live on Sky Sports Main Event and Premier League from 5pm; kick-off at 5.30pm  
  "I am playing with confidence. I feel good and I am helping the team."  
  Chelsea may have just dropped points to several of their top-four rivals after a goalless draw at Brentford on Wednesday night, but it's no surprise that Kepa Arrizabalaga was so cheerful when speaking to Amazon Prime after the game.  
  The clean sheet was the Blues' fifth in succession and extended their unbeaten run to seven matches in all competitions. Kepa's confidence comes from the fact he has been a key figure behind the team's upturn in form.  
  Live: SNF  
  After warming the bench in all but one of Chelsea's seven matches under Thomas Tuchel at the start of this season, the goalkeeper has been able to reclaim the No 1 shirt under new head coach Graham Potter thanks to some outstanding individual performances - and an unfortunately-timed injury to the previous first choice, Edouard Mendy.  
  But football moves fast and, just seven weeks after a transfer window in which he considered leaving Chelsea closed, Kepa now finally appears comfortable playing under the status as the world's most expensive 'keeper.  
  The case for Kepa over Mendy  
  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  
  Kepa Arrizabalaga makes an incredible point-blank save to keep out Danny Ings' header and preserve Chelsea's 1-0 lead against Aston Villa  
  Kepa's first appearance of the season came in Tuchel's final game in charge - the miserable 1-0 defeat away to Dinamo Zagreb at the start of September.  
  The assumption was Mendy would return to the side once he had shaken off a knee injury but, instead, he has been consigned to the role of substitute ever since.  
  Also See:  
  After starting in the defeat to Dinamo - which he stopped from being even more embarrassing thanks to a brilliant save to deny Stefan Ristovski in the second half - Kepa has retained the No 1 shirt for all seven of the matches Potter has overseen.  
  It's not just the stunning saves - the ones from Danny Ings and Jacob Ramsey in the win over Aston Villa were particularly impressive - that has seen the former Brighton boss keep faith in Kepa.  
  The graphic below compares the Spaniard's performance with Mendy's across a variety of metrics this season and shows he is outperforming his team-mate in a number of areas.  
  The higher number of clean sheets and fewer goals conceded can also be put down to the team's improved defensive performance since Potter arrived - after all, Tuchel had a similar impact immediately after replacing Frank Lampard in January 2021 - but Kepa deserves his share of the credit.  
  The next graphic further demonstrates the positive impact Kepa has had on Chelsea's results since usurping Mendy.  
  Again, the increase in goals scored and points won can in no small way be attributed to Potter's impact, but the difference when comparing the number of shots Kepa and Mendy let in compared to the number of goals they are expected to concede is stark.  
  Kepa's numbers show he is conceding just 0.25 goals per 90 minutes in the Premier League - a full 0.9 fewer than expected. In contrast, Mendy's goals conceded total is 0.06 higher than expected. It hardly paints him as a liability, yet clearly demonstrates the extent to which he has been outperformed by his deputy.  
  The 28-year-old has helped Chelsea to five consecutive clean sheets but he has not recorded six in a row since arriving from Athletic Bilbao more than four years ago. Helping the Blues to another shutout at home to Manchester United on Saturday - live on Sky Sports - would be the perfect way to do so.  
  How has Kepa improved?  
  While the statistics show Kepa deserves his place in the starting XI, do they also show he has improved as a player?  
  The answer appears to be yes. The table below shows that, not only is Kepa conceding fewer goals and making more saves this season than during the rest of his Chelsea career, but he's also been more authoritative in the air.  
  Kepa's progress this season  
  At just over 6'0", Kepa is not one of the taller 'keepers around and his ability to deal with high balls into the penalty area was criticised during his previous spell as the Blues' No 1. But, perhaps under instruction from Potter and his coaching staff or perhaps thanks to his new-found confidence, Kepa is now far more proactive when handling aerial threats.  
  While four matches is an admittedly small sample size, Kepa's output in the Premier League this season places him among the best in the division across a range of metrics.  
  Given Chelsea have conceded just one goal in Kepa's four matches it's not hard to see why he tops that leaderboard, but the fact he ranks third for saves per 90 minutes shows he isn't playing behind an impenetrable defence.  
  Ranking first for punched clearances is further evidence of his improvement under the high ball, while coming in second behind only Newcastle's Nick Pope for regains (when a 'keeper comes off their line to win possession for their team) demonstrates his suitability for Potter's style, which includes defending with a high line.  
  How errors crept into Mendy's game  
  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  
  Edouard Mendy's howler gifts Brenden Aaronson and Leeds the opening goal against Chelsea  
  While Kepa's renaissance has been a welcome boost for Chelsea and Potter, questions do need to be asked about why Mendy's form deserted him.  
  Injury was originally to blame for the Senegal international losing his place against Dinamo and he was unfortunate to be sidelined for Potter's first games in charge, handing Kepa a head start in the race to win the new head coach's affections.  
  But Mendy could have had no complaints if his demotion had been based purely on his performances, which were below his usually high standards. Compared to his first two seasons at Stamford Bridge, the 30-year-old was conceding more goals and recording fewer clean sheets this campaign, as well as completing a lower percentage of his passes and fewer regains of possession.  
  Mendy's drop in standards could be traced back to last season, when a gaffe with the ball at his feet handed West Ham a penalty in a 3-2 defeat at the London Stadium in December - a game that also saw the 'keeper palm Arthur Masuaku's cross into his own net to hand the Hammers a late winner.  
  Then, against Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals in April, Mendy underhit a pass to Antonio Rudiger when way outside his area that allowed Karim Benzema to pinch possession and roll the ball into the empty net during a 3-1 loss.  
  Another error occurred early this season during Chelsea's dismal 3-0 defeat at Leeds, which began with Mendy again having his pocket picked while dallying with the ball at his feet, allowing Brendon Aaronson to set the hosts on their way.  
  And his most recent appearance - the 2-1 win over West Ham last month - was capped with another mistake as he dropped the ball at the feet of Maxwel Cornet to gift the Hammers a late leveller that was controversially disallowed for a foul on the 'keeper.

  FREE TO WATCH: Highlights from Chelsea’s win against West Ham in the Premier League when Edouard Mendy was bailed out by a contentious VAR call  
  Chelsea's defensive decline during the second half of Tuchel's reign has been well documented and, as the starting goalkeeper for much of that time, Mendy must shoulder his share of responsibility.  
  What now for Chelsea's 'two No 1s'?  
  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  
  Ahead of Chelsea's draw at Brentford, Graham Potter gave his thoughts on Kepa Arrizabalaga, with the Spaniard having impressed since the new boss' arrival  
  Potter has so far been unwilling to verbally crown either Kepa or Mendy since taking the Chelsea job - referring to them as "two No 1s" - but his actions have done the talking. Kepa is undoubtedly the starter and is likely to hold onto the role if he maintains his impressive form.  
  As well as being welcome news for the head coach, Kepa's comeback is a boost for Todd Boehly and the rest of Chelsea's owners. The £71.6m the west London club spent to sign the Spaniard in the summer of 2018 remains the highest fee paid for a goalkeeper, and he reportedly receives a salary commensurate with that status.  
  Kepa's role as a back-up meant finding a club willing to give Chelsea a sizeable return on their investment and take on his wages was unlikely, with Tuchel admitting earlier this season that, in the most recent transfer window, the player "checked his options [but] they were not satisfying for him or for us."  
  But Kepa's current displays help to make the fee Chelsea paid for him look a little less reckless, while they will also serve to inflate his value should any club decide to present a satisfactory offer.  
  However, Kepa's rise has put Chelsea and Mendy in a slightly awkward situation. Reports last month suggested the club were keen to extend the 'keeper's contract - which expires in 2025 - but that he had turned down their initial offer.  
  Whether Chelsea choose to return with a new proposal, and whether Mendy would countenance signing it given he now finds himself on the bench, remains to be seen.  
  But Potter is likely to put those concerns to one side and instead relish having a goalkeeper in Kepa that is helping to establish the defensive solidity that has underpinned so much of Chelsea's past success.  
  Legends  
  Chelsea have a storied history as one of England’s most successful football clubs and have a long list of legends to suit. The Stamford Bridge natives have reached the top at home and in Europe. While some of the game’s greatest players have also donned their famed Blue shirts.  
  Legends have regularly added to Chelsea’s trophy history to live long in the hearts of their dedicated fanbase. So, The Chelsea Chronicle has taken a look at the top 10 legends of this giant club from their record goalscorer, Frank Lampard, to their fabled captain, John Terry…  
  Lampard cemented himself as a Chelsea legend during 13 years at Stamford Bridge as one of the greatest midfielders in Premier League history. He has also returned to west London twice to serve as Chelsea’s manager. But it was on the field where Lampard built his legacy.  
  Claudio Ranieri signed the West Ham United product from the Irons in June 2001 for £11m to replace Gus Poyet. The next 13 seasons would see Lampard write his name on the pages of Chelsea’s history books. He ultimately left in 2014 as their record goalscorer with 211 goals.  
  Lampard also won each major trophy available with Chelsea with three Premier League titles, a Champions League title, four FA Cups, two EFL Cups and a Europa League title. While his role in their 2004/05 top-flight title also led to the PFA and Fans’ Player of the Year awards.  
  He even had the honour of lifting Chelsea’s first Champions League title and was crucial to their route to Munich. Lampard was also the perfect professional, always working behind the scenes to improve his game wherever the complete midfield icon saw any scope to develop.  
  Terry is not only a legend of Chelsea but is also the Blues’ most successful player following a trophy-laden 19 seasons at Stamford Bridge. Their former club captain won 15 major titles in west London. He even touched his first piece of silverware in 2000 and lifted his last in 2017.  
  The defender’s 19 years as a first-team player further saw Terry amass 717 appearances in all competitions for Chelsea. He was always one of the best defenders of a generation and one of England’s greatest-ever centre-halves. Terry even first took their captaincy in 2001.  
  Ranieri gave Terry his breakthrough despite boasting the likes of Marcel Desailly and Frank Leboeuf. He had been with the Blues since the age of 14 and went on to become a key part of Chelsea becoming a heavyweight force with five top-flight titles and five FA Cup trophies.  
  Terry would take the captain’s armband in more than 500 games after becoming the skipper permanently during the 2004/05 term. His leadership and tactical awareness, along with his immense natural talent, made Terry essential to Chelsea’s foundations under many coaches.  
  Gianfranco Zola  
  Not only is Gianfranco Zola an inarguable Chelsea legend, the Blues’ fanbase even voted the Italian as their greatest-ever player in 2003. He earned a staggering 60% of the votes when Chelsea polled their supporters having captivated Stamford Bridge for the prior seven years.  
  Zola moved to west London in 1996 and would win four trophies by the time he left. He also left having scored 80 – often spectacular – goals, including the winner in the 1998 European Cup Winners’ Cup Final. The maestro hit home within seconds of coming on as a substitute.  
  Defenders would chase shadows trying to stop Zola after he set off on his trademark mazey runs. His intelligence regularly proved too much for clubs to handle and Zola even left Peter Schmeichel motionless with another of his stunning strikes to inspire Chelsea’s resurgence.  
  But as well as being an incredible player, Zola was also true to his word when he eventually left Chelsea. The Italian had reached an agreement to move to his hometown side, Cagliari, one day before Roman Abramovich became Chelsea’s owner in 2003 and stuck to his word.  
  Chelsea narrowly beat the transfer deadline in August 2006 to sign a future club legend for £5m and William Gallas from Arsenal in Ashley Cole. The England international was already one of the best left-backs in the game and would be the best in the world for several years.  
  Cole had won two Premier League titles with the Gunners and won his third top-flight title with Chelsea in 2009/10. The defender’s spell in west London further featured four FA Cup titles and one EFL Cup trophy plus Champions League and Europa League winners’ medals.  
  He would eventually leave Stamford Bridge in 2014 having amassed 338 appearances with the Blues. While Cole’s efforts in the FA Cup saw the defender become the most successful player in the competition’s history. No player has ever matched his seven trophies to date.  
  What set Cole apart from the left-backs of his generation was his infinite reliability. He was also the ultimate big-game player as coaches could rely on Cole to deliver when it counted. Few nights showed it more than the 2012 Champions League semi-finals against Barcelona.  
  Chelsea broke their transfer record in 2004 to see new boss Jose Mourinho claim the £24m signing of Didier Drogba. It also made the forward the most expensive striker in the English game at the time. But very few fans could now argue the price for his move from Marseille.  
  Drogba is among Chelsea’s all-time record goalscorers with the Blues legend striking 164 in 381 outings across his two spells. Mourinho later brought the Ivory Coast icon back to west London for one more season in 2014. Drogba offered seven of his goals in his second spell.  
  Chelsea owe a great deal to Drogba for many of the titles that now feature in their trophy cabinet, as well. The striker was an ultimate big-game player and scored nine goals in nine cup finals. His haul included a 24-yard free-kick to pip Portsmouth in the 2010 FA Cup final.  
  While Drogba was essential to the biggest night in Chelsea’s history having scored the 88th-minute equaliser against Bayern Munich in the Champions League final in 2012. The striker, who won the Man of the Match award, met Juan Mata’s corner and powered a header home.  
  Among the legends to have played for Chelsea throughout the years, Eden Hazard is one of the – if not the – most skilful players to have donned their blue jersey. The Belgian was the Blues’ talisman for seven years and won their Player of the Year award a record four times.  
  Hazard arrived in west London as the most coveted young player in the world in 2012 from his boyhood team. Chelsea paid LOSC Lille £32m on the back of them lifting the Champions League. Yet he would leave for Real Madrid in 2019 for £89m, rising to in excess of £150m.  
  Chelsea lifted two Premier League titles and two Europa League titles during Hazard’s spell with the Blues, as well. While his dazzling displays earned wider acclaim as one of the best players in Europe. The winger was essential to the way the Stamford Bridge natives played.  
  His pace and trickery would bamboozle defenders, who often resorted to trying to foul the forward to stop his runs. But despite the tough treatment that Hazard received, he seldom missed matches for Chelsea. He also often played the game with a genial smile on his face.  
  Peter Osgood  
  Such is Peter Osgood’s legend at Chelsea, the Blues built a statue of the club’s iconic striker outside the West Stand at Stamford Bridge. The west London team recognised the Windsor-born forward’s role in their glorious spells over the 1960s and 1970s with the statue in 2010.  
  Osgood started his career in Chelsea’s academy but stole the headlines on his senior debut. Tommy Docherty brought the forward through aged 17 in 1964 and he scored twice against Workington in a League Cup tie. It was to be the start of great things to come for the Blues.  
  A broken leg interrupted Osgood’s first two seasons at the Bridge but he returned to fitness as an even better player. The striker added a real toughness to his natural talent to become a mainstay for a decade. He was instinctive with either foot to overcome losing a yard of pace.  
  Chelsea’s decline in the mid-1970s brought about the end of Osgood’s first stint at the club. And while he returned for what would be the last season of his career in 1978/79, the striker did not prevent their relegation. But the history books will forever remember his 150 goals.  
  Ron Harris holds his own among the top 10 Chelsea legends of all time having enjoyed a club record 795 appearances. His 18 years at Stamford Bridge cemented the defender’s legacy at the Blues after breaking through from their academy fold in 1962 as an FA Youth Cup winner.  
  Docherty ushered Harris into Chelsea’s first-team squad aged 17 and they would seal their promotion the following year. But Harris’ legend was still to unfold as he would be Chelsea’s first FA Cup-winning captain in 1969/70. He also lifted their first European title the next year.  
  Chelsea won the European Cup Winners’ Cup in 1970/71 but their successes declined in the following years. Yet while others disembarked the Blues’ ship, Harris stayed put – even after Ray Wilkins assumed the captaincy. It was not until 1980 that Harris eventually left the club.  
  Brentford broke Harris’ long-time association with Chelsea with the chance to become their player-manager. He left Stamford Bridge as an incontestable Chelsea legend beyond his 795 record appearances. His uncompromising style warmly earned him the nickname ‘Chopper’.  
  Chelsea finally reached an agreement with Stade Rennais to sign Petr Cech in 2004 for £7m. The Czech Republic goalkeeper had long been a target of the Blues and the next 11 seasons saw him become a Chelsea legend. Arsenal ended his career at the Bridge for £10m in 2015.  
  Cech changed west for north London after losing his first choice status between the posts to Thibaut Courtois. But the Czech legend would return after retiring in 2019 as a technical and performance advisor. He even re-joined Chelsea’s side in 2020 as an emergency goalkeeper.  
  Chelsea won every title possible over Cech’s storied 11 years at the Bridge with four Premier League titles featuring prominently. He also won the Champions League and Europa League, plus four FA Cups and three EFL Cup titles. Cech also had 202 Premier League clean sheets.  
  The Blues took a chance when signing Cech as he had only played 78 first-team games with Rennes. Yet Chelsea’s swoop proved to be a masterstroke as the shot-stopper would prove to be among the best around. Cech even also came back to thrive after fracturing his skull.  
  Jimmy Greaves  
  Jimmy Greaves joined Chelsea as a junior in 1956. But he only had to wait until the opening day of the 1957/58 season to make his first-team debut. Ted Drake would quickly savour his call, too, as Greaves marked his bow by scoring in a 1-1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur aged 17.  
  Drake had little choice but to give Greaves a chance in Chelsea’s first-team having scored an astounding 114 goals at the junior level. His potential would not fade, either, as the forward went on to score a remarkable 132 goals in 169 outings. His hit rate is unlikely to be beaten.  
  Greaves scored 22 goals in his debut campaign before netting 37, 30 and 43 in the seasons to follow. His incredible record also featured 13 hat-tricks, including scoring five goals in one game three times. Greaves even scored four goals in one game on a further three occasions.  
  Chelsea failing to win a trophy despite Greaves’ insane output saw the Blues cash in on him in 1961. Yet his move to AC Milan would not be a success and the striker sought to return to Stamford Bridge. But Chelsea refused to enter a bidding war and he signed with Tottenham.

  What is Liverpool FC?  
  Liverpool FC is an English professional football (soccer) club based in Liverpool, England. It is the most successful English team in European football tournament history, having won six European Cup/Champions League trophies. The club has also won the English top-division league title 19 times.  
  Why was Liverpool FC founded?  
  Liverpool FC was formed following a dispute between Everton FC and Anfield stadium’s owner, John Houlding. It resulted in Everton FC moving to Goodison Park and Houlding forming a new team that eventually became Liverpool FC. The new club played its first game in 1892 and won its first league title in the 1900–01 season.  
  Why was Liverpool FC banned from European competition in 1985?  
  Liverpool FC was banned from European competition for six years after an incident where 39 fans were killed at Heysel Stadium as a result of the collapse of a stadium wall when Liverpool fans charged Juventus supporters in 1985.  
  How many Liverpool FC fans died as a result of the Hillsborough disaster?  
  In 1989 during a Football Association Cup semifinal match at the Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, a crush of people resulted in 97 deaths and hundreds of injuries. (A total of 95 people died in 1989; two others died later as a result of their injuries, in 1993 and 2021.) It was England’s deadliest sporting disaster.  
  Liverpool FC, English professional football (soccer) club based in Liverpool. It is the most successful English team in European football tournament history, having won six European Cup/Champions League trophies. The club has also won the English top-division league title 19 times.  
  Everton FC was the first football team to play in the Anfield stadium that is famous today as Liverpool FC’s historic home. A dispute between Everton and the site’s owner, John Houlding, resulted in Everton moving to Goodison Park and Houlding forming a new team that was eventually named Liverpool FC. The new club played its first game in 1892 and won its first league title in the 1900–01 season. In 1906 Anfield’s newly constructed terrace grandstand was christened Spion Kop for its resemblance to a hill where a famous South African War battle had been fought, which led to the well-known “Kopites” nickname for Liverpool’s fans.  
  Two managers, Bill Shankly (1959–74) and Bob Paisley (1974–83), were responsible for much of Liverpool’s success. Shankly took Liverpool from the English second division to win three English top-division league titles (1963–64, 1965–66, and 1972–73), as well as a Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Cup victory in 1973. Paisley added a second UEFA Cup in 1976, six English league titles, and three European Cup wins (1977, 1978, and 1981). A fourth European Cup victory came in 1984, and Liverpool reached the final the following year against Juventus at the Heysel Stadium in Belgium. The match was marred by tragedy as 39 fans were killed, primarily by the collapse of a stadium wall that was caused by Liverpool fans charging Juventus supporters. Liverpool was banned from European competition for six years—and all English clubs were banned for five years—after the incident. Another tragedy struck the club in 1989 when, during a Football Association (FA) Cup semifinal match at the Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, a crush of fans resulted in 97 deaths and hundreds of injuries—England’s deadliest sporting disaster.  
  After that turbulent period, Liverpool won a third UEFA Cup competition (2001), took the 2005 and 2019 Champions League titles, and broke a 30-year streak without a domestic title by capturing the 2019–20 Premier League championship. The club also captured a total of eight FA Cup and nine League Cup victories. Successful Liverpool teams were renowned for a solid defense that set the table for exciting forwards such as Roger Hunt, Kevin Keegan, Ian Rush, Kenny Dalglish (who managed the club from 1985 to 1991), and Michael Owen, as well as attacking midfielder Steven Gerrard.  
  Liverpool FC  
  Since they were founded in 1892, the Liverpool Football Club name was synonymous with fame and glory. Internationally, Liverpool is the most successful British club of all time with plenty of European trophies on their record. They are one of the most popular football teams in the world, with over 200 supporter clubs in at least 50 different countries. And yet, their magnificent history will forever be plagued by two of the worst stadium disasters of all time: Heysel and Hillsborough.

  Liverpool team picture from the club's first season.  
  History  
  Following the moving of Everton to Goodison Park in 1892, the club's then-president John Houlding suddenly found himself with the rights to Anfield stadium and no team to play on it. Always a practical man, Houlding quickly decided to circumvent this problem by forming his own club – Liverpool (should not be confused with Liverpool Ramblers AFC that was founded ten years earlier). After becoming a member of the Football League in 1893, the team managed to get promoted to first division after one season in the second division. Early on, Liverpool established themselves as one of England's top clubs, winning League titles in 1901, 1906, 1922 and 1923.  
  The Bill Shankly era  
  Though an immensely popular club even then, Liverpool FC were not particularly consistent in the post-WWII period. After claiming their fourth League title in 1947, the club entered a period of mediocrity which culminated with their relegation to Second Division in 1954. Things took a turn for the better after Bill Shankly was hired as manager, however; Shankly's first order of business was to release the entire first team squad. He then turned the club's storage room into the famous "Boot Room", a place that would serve as the coaches' secret meeting place for the next three decades. Shankly's unorthodox methods bore fruit soon enough. After making their way back to the First Division in 1962, Liverpool won the League two years later. During the reminder of Shankly's tenure as manager, they claimed an additional two League titles (1966, 1973), two FA Cups (1965, 1974), as well as their first European trophy – the 1973 UEFA Cup. In 1974, Shankly resigned from his job due to a need for a break, leaving the club in the hands of his assistant, Bob Paisley.  
  Adding more trophies to the collection  
  The change of personnel did not do much to stop Liverpool's dominance. Under Paisley, Liverpool were a remarkably consistent team; during his nine years in charge, the club won an incredible six League titles and three League Cups. Their reign spread over Europe as well, with Liverpool winning one UEFA Cup and three European Cups in the period between 1976 and 1981. After Paisley's retirement in 1983, his assistant Joe Fagan continued the successful tradition by leading the team to a Treble in his first season in charge.

  The Heysel and Hillsborough tragedies  
  In 1985, Liverpool faced Juventus in the European Cup final. Unfortunately, that match is now widely known as the scene of the Heysel disaster; after some unruly fans caused a perimeter wall to collapse, 39 fans were crushed to death. In the aftermath, considering the blame for the accident was placed solely on Liverpool fans, all English clubs were banned from European competitions for the next five years. In the absence of European games, Liverpool started focusing on the domestic competitions. But after winning two more League titles in 1986 and 1988 and an FA Cup in 1985, tragedy struck again. In the 1989 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, 94 fans died in a crowd crush only six minutes after the game had started. To this day, the Hillsborough disaster remains the worst stadium disaster in English football. After claiming their ninth League title in 1990, Liverpool entered a downward spiral. With only a couple of Cup trophies and some mediocre league finishes in the 90s and early 00s, it seemed like Liverpool's star had waned. Nevertheless, they proved their mettle in the most exhilarating way possible; after reaching the Champions League final in 2005, they recovered from 3-0 down at half-time to eventually beat Milan on penalties. As it turned out, this extraordinary victory was the club's swan song. During the next decade, Liverpool were mostly seen playing second fiddle to other English clubs, with only two Cup trophies and a second-place league finish to show for their efforts.  
  A return to the top  
  Liverpool was close to win Premier League as runners up in 2002, 2014 and 2019. But in 2020 everything fall into place, Liverpool led by German coach Jürgen Klopp pulled away from the competition and the sky turned red when the league was finally decided, after being interrupted for a period due to the coronavirus outbreak.  
  Logo  
  The most characteristic part of the logo is the drawing of the mythical “Liver Bird”, which is the symbol of the City of Liverpool.

  Marina Granovskaia linked to secret payments by former Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich  
  Powerful chief executive of Chelsea under Abramovich appears in documents showing offshore payments by oligarch  
  The former chief executive of ­Chelsea, once described as “the most powerful woman in football”, is ­facing ­questions about what she knew of secret payments made under the club’s former owner Roman ­Abramovich, amid a continuing investigation into alleged breaches of football spending rules.  
  Details of millions of pounds in fees, funded by offshore investment vehicles belonging to the Russian ­oligarch, emerged last year as a result of the Cyprus Confidential leaks ­project, published by the Guardian and international partners.  
  Documents from the files ­indicate that Marina Granovskaia, a close associate of Abramovich who ran Chelsea until he sold the club in May 2022, knew about some of the ­transactions, including a fee paid to the agent of star player Eden Hazard.  
  She also appears to have ­benefited personally from some of the ­payments, raising questions over whether she received extra money from Abramovich for her work at the club, on top of her Chelsea salary. The files suggest offshore companies in the Abramovich network made loans to Granovskaia worth £7.5m to finance the purchase of a house in Fulham, near the club’s Stamford Bridge stadium, and a payment of £1.63m for “financial, tax and legal due diligence”.  
  The Premier League is ­investigating whether ­Abramovich secretly subsidised his team by using offshore companies to make payments which should, under rules designed to ensure fair competition, have been made by the club itself from its own bank accounts.  
  The material raises questions about oversight of the club’s affairs by its board, which was chaired by the American lawyer Bruce Buck ­during Abramovich’s highly ­successful reign. Buck was a partner at the law firm Skadden, which acted for Chelsea and Abramovich for two decades, and held senior positions at the Premier League, which acts as both regulator and promoter for its member clubs.  
  The Premier League ­investigation was triggered after the club’s new owners, a consortium whose ­figurehead is the US investor Todd Boehly, reported suspected breaches by previous management. An ­independent panel of sports law experts will be convened that could summon former club ­executives to give evidence. Should the panel find Chelsea guilty, it has the power to impose financial or ­sporting ­punishments, such as a points deduction.  
  No details of the transactions under investigation have been publicly disclosed by the club, or the Premier League and Football Association.  
  However, a leak of documents from an accounting firm in Cyprus which acted for Abramovich revealed a series of payments over a decade to managers, scouts and football agents connected to Chelsea. The ­information, published as part of the Cyprus Confidential series, was shared with the Guardian by the International Consortium of ­Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and Germany’s Paper Trail Media.  
  Beneficiaries of secret payments included the agent of Hazard, the files suggest, while other transactions appear to have been connected to the purchase of the Brazil forward Willian and the Cameroonstriker Samuel Eto’o.  
  Granovskaia appears to have been sent copies of agreements relating to those payments.  
  The Russian, 49, rose from ­working as Abramovich’s executive assistant to overseeing Chelsea’s financial and sporting affairs on the oligarch’s behalf, a job that saw her dubbed the “most powerful woman in football”.  
  Less than a month after she became chief executive of the club in October 2014, the ­British Virgin Islands-registered Ovington Worldwide – owned by ­Abramovich – agreed to make three loans to Granovskaia worth a ­combined £12.5m, documents in the leak reveal.  
  According to credit agreements, two of the loans, dated November 2014 and worth a combined £7.5m, were to finance the purchase of a property.  
  Less than six months later, Land Registry filings show, Granovskaia bought a home in London for £5.05m.  
  At least £7.5m of the debt to ­Abramovich was due to be waived under subsequent debt ­forgiveness deeds.  
  On top of the loans, between 2010 and 2019 Ovington Worldwide agreed to pay her at least £1.63m under an advisory services ­agreement for “financial, tax and legal due diligence”.  
  Leading sports lawyers have ­previously told the Guardian that any payment for services to Chelsea ought to have been borne by the club and that any failure to disclose them in the club’s accounts might be seen as a breach of Premier League rules.  
  The documents also suggest that Granovskaia may have known of ­payments made by one of ­Abramovich’s offshore vehicles to a football agent and an adviser, both of whom did business with Chelsea.  
  In April 2013, the Cyprus-based financial services firm MeritServus, which managed offshore companies for Roman Abramovich, wrote to Granovskaia at her postal address at Chelsea’s stadium.  
  MeritServus said it had enclosed a copy of an “advisory services ­agreement” with Gulf Value FZE, a company owned by John Bico, the former agent of Hazard. As the ­Guardian has previously revealed, the agreement involved Bico’s ­company receiving a £7m fee from ­Leiston Holdings, an offshore ­company owned by Abramovich.  
  A year earlier, MeritServus also sent Granovskaia a copy of an ­advisory agreement between Leiston and the former Dutch football coach Piet De Visser, who became one of Abramovich’s most trusted advisers during his ownership of Chelsea.  
  Under the ­agreement, Leiston agreed to pay De Visser a €48,000 “retainer” and a further €4,000 a month for “scouting and other ­football related advice”, over 12 months.  
  Granovskaia did not return requests for comment.  
  Chelsea’s free-spending strategy under Abramovich has long attracted concern within football, with the then Arsenal ­manager Arsène Wenger describing it as “financial doping” in 2005. The former Uefa president Michel Platini warned in 2008 that “the ones who cheat [with debt-fuelled spending] are going on to win”.  
  But the Premier League, which oversees top club’s finances, did not open an investigation into Chelsea until last year, after the club’s new owners reported that “incomplete financial information” had been ­submitted during Abramovich’s tenure.  
  In 2012, while Buck was chairman of Chelsea and the Premier League’s pay committee, he promised Chelsea would comply with Uefa’s “financial fair play” spending limits, imposed in 2011, via legitimate means.  
  These, he said, would include ­cutting ­spending and increasing sponsorship ­revenues. The following year, he criticised FFP rules, which he said risked maintaining the “status quo” in football. The Premier League imposed its own spending limits two years later.  
  Leaked files indicate that ­Skadden, the law firm where Buck was a ­partner, may have performed work for Leiston Holdings, the offshore vehicle owned by Abramovich that was the source of many of the ­payments likely to be investigated by the Premier League.  
  In a document that describes ­Leiston as the “customer” and ­Abramovich’s personal investment firm Millhouse as the “executor”, Skadden is listed among companies to have provided services requiring “transfer outside Russian federation” during 2014. Buck’s name does not appear in the document.  
  Lawyers for Buck did not return requests for comment. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom did not return requests for comment.  
  Chelsea FC has previously said that the payments pre-date the current ownership regime and that the club had self-reported “potential financial irregularities” from that period to the football authorities.

  Last Call for the Montana Club, and a Past Straight Out of ‘Yellowstone’  
  The century-old club, in Helena, had a celebrated Black bartender and a membership of Montana’s biggest movers and shakers.  
  The Montana Club, a celebrated bar, dining room and gathering place in Helena that was founded by frontier movers and shakers in 1885 — four years before Montana became a state — will close its doors after one final toast on March 29.  
  The club, which also holds a notable place in Black history, has been in financial straits in recent years, leading to a bankruptcy filing in November. (The club is not associated with the Montana Club restaurant chain.)  
  Before it reorganized in 2018 as a cooperative open to the public, the private club attracted an elite membership that would be right at home in the TV series “Yellowstone” — the mining, livestock and timber barons, and bankers, politicians and lawyers who steered the state’s fortunes over the years. (In fact, Cole Hauser, a star of the show, is a descendant of Samuel Hauser, a Montana territorial governor and a founder of the club, according to Charles Robison, its current president.)  
  “For a long time, everyone who was shaping the state belonged to the Montana Club,” Mr. Robison said.  
  That said, one of club’s most significant figures was a bartender who made culinary history there a century ago.

  Oldest football clubs  
  The world's oldest clubs playing various codes of football  
  The oldest football clubs trace their origins to the mid-19th century, a period when football evolved from being a casual pastime to an organised mainstream sport.  
  The identity of the oldest football clubs in the world, or even in a particular country, is often disputed or claimed by several clubs, across several codes of football. The Foot-Ball Club of Edinburgh is thought to be the earliest recorded football club in the world, with records going back to 1824. Rugby clubs also referred to themselves, or continue to refer to themselves, as simply a "football club", or as a "rugby football club". "Club" has always meant an independent entity and, during the historical period in question, very few high school or university teams were independent of the educational institutions concerned. Consequently, school and university football teams were seldom referred to as "clubs". That has always been the case, for example, in American football, which has always had ties to college sport in general. Conversely, however, the oldest still-existing "football club" with a well-documented, continuous history is Dublin University Football Club, a rugby union club founded in 1854 at Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland. There exists some record of Guy's Hospital Football Club being founded in London in 1843, through an 1883 fixture card referring to Guy's 40th season.[1]  
  Newspaper articles describing the game between the Body-guard Club and the Fear-nought Club, held on Christmas Day 1841  
  While the first clubs emerged in Britain, possibly as early as the fifteenth century, these are poorly-documented and defunct. For example, the records of the Brewers' Company of London between 1421 and 1423 mention the hiring out of their hall "by the "football players" for "20 pence", under the heading "Trades and Fraternities".[2] The listing of football players as a "fraternity" or a group of players meeting socially under this identity is the earliest allusion to what might be considered a football club.[3] Other early sporting bodies dedicated to playing football include "The Gymnastic Society" of London which met regularly during the second half of the eighteenth century to pursue two sports: football and wrestling.[4] The club played its matches – for example between London-based natives of Cumberland and Westmorland – at the Kennington Common from well before 1789 until about 1800.  
  The Foot-Ball Club (active 1824–41) of Edinburgh, Scotland, is the first documented club dedicated to football, and the first to describe itself as a football club.[5] The only surviving club rules forbade tripping, but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.[6] Other documents describe a game involving 39 players and "such kicking of shins and such tumbling".  
  Wikisource has original text related to this article:  
  Other early clubs include the Great Leicestershire Cricket and Football Club present in 1840.[7]  
  On Christmas Day 1841, an early documented match between two self-described "football clubs" took place. The Body-guard Club (of Rochdale) lost to the Fear-nought Club after using an ineligible player as a substitute.[8][9][10] The complete rules used in this game are unknown, but they specified twelve players on each side,[9] with each team providing its own umpire, and the game being started by the firing of a pistol.[10]  
  A club for playing "cricket, quoits and football" was established in Newcastle on Tyne in or before 1848.[11] The Surrey Football Club was established in 1849 and published the first non-school football list of rules (which were probably based upon the eighteenth century Gymnastic Society cited above[12]). Windsor Home Park F.C. was in existence as early as 1854,[13] and would go on to compete in early editions of the FA Cup.[14]  
  Supported by the Guinness Book of Records, and founded by staff at Guy's Hospital in London in 1843, the Guy's, Kings and St Thomas' RFC would be the oldest "football" club of any code. Nevertheless, the connection between the present club and the original "Guy's Hospital" formed in 1843 is still disputed,[15] alleging that the present club is a modern amalgam of three formerly distinct hospital rugby clubs, starting with the Guy's Hospital and St Thomas' Hospital teams which were the first to merge following the union of their respective Medical Departments. The last department to merge was the King's College Hospital in 1999, although its club (founded in 1869) remained as a separate institution.  
  It has been claimed that the present-day Barnes Rugby Football Club, from Barnes in London, is a continuation of the nineteenth-century Barnes Football Club, and moreover that the latter club was formed in 1839 and is thus the oldest club to have played football for its entire history.[18] However, as of 2018, Barnes RFC's website claims only that the club was established in the 1920s, while alluding to "possibilities" that its history stretches back to 1862.[19] In 2021, people with heritage and local enthusiasts revived the old Barnes Football Club, established in 1862.  
  Sheffield F.C. in England, is the world's oldest surviving independent open football club: that is, the oldest club not associated with an institution such as a school, hospital or university; and which was open to all to play. It was founded in 1857.[20] Sheffield F.C. initially played Sheffield rules, a code of its own devising, although the club's rules influenced those of the England Football Association (FA) (1863) including handball, free kicks, corners and throw ins. While the international governing body of association football, FIFA and the FA recognise Sheffield F.C. as the "world's oldest football club",[21] and the club joined the FA in 1863, it continued to use the Sheffield rules. Sheffield F.C. did not officially adopt association football until 1877.  
  Setting its birth date in 1856, Cambridge University A.F.C. has been described by the university as the oldest club now playing association football,[22][23][24] being recognised by The FA.[25] For example, : "Salopians formed a club of their own in the late 1830s/early 1840s but that was presumably absorbed by the Cambridge University Football Club that they were so influential in creating in 1846".[26] According to Charles Astor Bristed, in the early 1840s at Cambridge, there were games played between clubs from colleges and houses.[27] Football is documented as being played on the original club ground, Parkers Piece, as early as 1838.[28] The earliest existing evidence of the Cambridge University Football Club comes from "The Laws of the University Football Club" dated 1856, and held at Shrewsbury School.[24] The Cambridge rules of 1863 would provide the basis for the FA's original rules.  
  The only survivor among the FA's founding clubs still playing association football is Civil Service F.C.[29] Six of the 18 founding members later adopted rugby exclusively.[30] Cray Wanderers F.C., originally of St Mary Cray and currently playing in Bromley, founded in 1860, is the oldest club now playing association football in Greater London.[31] The code played by Cray Wanderers in its earliest years is unknown.  
  Liverpool Football Club (not to be confused with Liverpool F.C. of the Premier League), later known as Liverpool St Helens F.C., were formed in 1857, which claims to be the oldest open rugby club in the world. The club adopted the Rugby Union rules in 1872, never playing association rules.  
  The first football club to be founded in Albania was the Vllaznia Sport Club on 16 February 1919.  
  Football Club Spa was founded by the Hunter-Blair family of Blairquhan, Ayrshire, Scotland, and was in operation in 1863. The fourth Baronet took his family there in order to economise.[33] The oldest club still in existence today in Belgium is Royal Antwerp FC, founded in 1880.[citation needed]  
  The oldest football club in Bosnia and Herzegovina is FK Sloboda founded in Novi Grad in 1910. The first club to be ever founded was Zrinjski Mostar in 1903, but it was inactive between 1945 and 1996.  
  The oldest still active football club in Croatia is NK Rijeka, formed in 1904 and playing association football at the latest in 1906,[34] currently competing in the first Croatian league. HNK Segesta, that plays in the third division, was possibly founded in 1906, but its first recorded match was held in 1909.[35]  
  Anorthosis Famagusta FC founded in 1911 is the oldest club with a football team, however it was a reading club and the football division of the club started in 1929, the same year Omonia Aradippou was founded. The now defunct football division of Enosis Neon Trust founded in 1924 is therefore the oldest football club, however the club closed its football division in 1938. The oldest surviving football club is therefore APOEL founded in 1926. The same year the now defunct Keravnos Strovolou FC was founded. The now defunct Pezoporikos Larnaca FC was founded in 1927 first merging to form EPA Larnaca FC in 1930. AEL Limassol and Aris Limassol both founded in 1930 and one year after the Anorthosis football division are therefore old clubs as well. Olympiakos Nicosia and Digenis Akritas Morphou FC were both subsequently founded in 1931.  
  Kjøbenhavns Boldklub is the oldest football club in Denmark and the oldest active club in continental Europe.[36] The sports club was formed in 1876 and association football was first played two years later.[37]  
  In nowadays Estonian state was the oldest formed club Tallinna Jalgpalliselts Meteor in 1908. It's defunct since 1911, but restored after First World War and Estonian War of Independence in 1926 under the name Tallinna SK Meteor which took action until 1937.  
  The first football club in France was established in Paris in 1863 by English expatriates, as the following excerpt from a contemporary newspaper shows: "A number of English gentlemen living in Paris have lately organised a football club.... The football contests take place in the Bois de Boulogne, by permission of the authorities and surprise the French amazingly".[38]  
  Le Havre AC was founded as an athletics and rugby club in 1872, making it the oldest surviving football club registered in France and continental Europe.[39] They began playing association football on a regular basis in 1894. Technically AS Strasbourg could be considered the first French association football team, being established in 1890; they were however a German team at the time.  
  The oldest surviving rugby football club is Heidelberger RK, which was founded on 9 May 1872 as a rowing and rugby club. The HRK has won 14 national titles 1927, 1928, 1971, 1973, 1976, 1986, 2010–2015, 2017 and 2018. The biggest success of the club was the qualification for the Rugby European Challenge Cup 2018/19 - only to be denied participation, because their main sponsor owns Stade Français. The second oldest still surviving rugby club is Hannover 1878 founded 1878 and winning 9 German championships. Both clubs still play in the 1. Bundesliga.[citation needed]  
  The first association football in Germany (and likely the first outside Great Britain) was Dresden English, founded on 18 March 1874. The club had over 70 members by then, primarily Englishmen working in Dresden, with its matches being attended by hundreds of spectators. Nevertheless, Dresden English was dissolved in 1898.[citation needed]  
  The oldest still active association football club is BFC Germania 1888 founded on 15 April 1888. They play in the 10th division as of season 2020/21 and never managed to win any national titles.[citation needed]  
  The oldest still active football clubs in Hungary are Műegyetemi AFC founded in autumn 1897 as a proper football club and III. Kerületi TVE, which whose football section was founded officially in 1899 but stemmed from the 1897-founded Budai Football Csapat. The first ever football club to be founded in Hungary was Budapesti Torna Club having founded its football section in February 1897, dissolved in 1945–46.[citation needed]  
  In Italy, Genoa C.F.C. is the oldest active football club: it was founded by Charles De Grave Sells, S. Green, George Blake, W. Rilley, George Dormer Fawcus, H.M. Sandys, E. De Thierry, Johnathan Summerhill Sr., Johnathan Summerhill Jr. and Sir Charles Alfred Payton in Genoa on 7 September 1893. However, Genoa C.F.C. was not the first Italian football club, being Torino Football & Cricket Club (1887)[40] but its history lasted only for 4 years. Founded by Edoardo Bosio (owner of Bosio & Caratsch, the earliest brewery in Italy), the team broke up in 1891. Older than Genoa and Torino is Associazione Sportiva Dilettantistica Fanfulla, a sports club founded in Lodi in 1873, but its football section was established thirty-five years later in 1908.  
  Workers at the (British-owned) Salamandra metal factory in Riga founded the first football team in 1907: the British Football Club (later named Britannia).  
  The first inter-city football games are dating back to 1911. Shortly after gaining the independence in 1918, a Kybartai local of a German descent has purchased a ball, leveled out a football pitch, and gathered a team together. The team formed into a football club FK Sveikata in 1919. For the next three years the team was traveling to cities in East Prussia and Klaipėda Region to play games, as there were no other teams in Lithuania just yet.[41] FK Sveikata is still a functioning club in Lithuania today.  
  The oldest football club in Malta is St.George's FC. Founded in 1890 in the city of Cospicua also known as Bormla.  
  The oldest football club in Montenegro is FK Lovćen founded in the town of Cetinje in 1913.  
  The oldest football (and oldest cricket) club in the Netherlands is Koninklijke UD from Deventer, founded in 1875 as a cricket club.[42] In 1894, the club founded an association football section.[43]  
  Koninklijke HFC was the first Dutch rugby club, established on 15 September 1879 by the 14-year-old Pim Mulier, who first encountered the sport in 1870. However, HFC switched to association football in 1883.  
  Utrechtse Sportvereniging Hercules (Utrecht Sports Association Hercules), also known as USV Hercules or Hercules Utrecht, is an amateur football club in Utrecht, established on 22 April 1882.  
  The oldest football club in North Macedonia is founded in 1919 and it's FK Ljuboten.  
  The first football team in Norway was probably started by a buekorps in Bergen, Nygaards Bataljon, in 1883.[4] In 1885 the first Norwegian club however, Idrætsforeningen Odd, was founded in Skien. The footballing interest was very low, and was put on ice after a few months. However, the club Odd Grenland started up with football again in 1894, and are now Norway's oldest football club.  
  Czarni Lwów. This club is also believed to have been founded in 1903, but historical records are unclear as to the exact date of foundation.  
  When Lviv became a part of Ukraine (then part of the USSR) the clubs ceased to exist.[44]  
  The oldest currently existing football club within Poland's current borders is widely considered to be Cracovia, but this is disputed by their Kraków arch-rivals Wisła Kraków; both clubs were founded in 1906,[45] however there are multiple proofs that Wisła is younger.[46] Resovia also lay claim to this distinction; the disputes centre around registration, continuity of a given team, and sources.[47]  
  The first football club was founded in 1900 by the German minority in Ljubljana, the Laibacher Sportverein and got discontinued in 1909,[49] followed by the Hungarian minority Lendevai FE in 1903, and the German minority in Celje (Athletik SK in 1906). In 1911, the first Slovenian football club of the Slovenian minority opened in Ljubljana, Ilirija, followed by Slovan two years later. Ilirija is nowadays considered by the Slovenian FA as the oldest running football club in the country, because the Lendava-based club went bankrupt in 2012, although it got recreated right away.[50]  
  Founded on 23 December 1889, Recreativo de Huelva is the oldest football club in Spain. Two Scots, Alexander Mackay and Robert Russell Ross, overseas workers at the Rio Tinto mines, founded Huelva Recreation Club to provide their employees with physical recreation. Recreativo de Huelva predates Sevilla Foot-ball Club, which was founded a month later and it is related with Sevilla FC, according to recent studies presented by the Club and approved by UEFA and RFEF.  
  FC St. Gallen 1879 is the oldest active football club in Switzerland and the second oldest in continental Europe, founded on 19 April 1879 as FC St. Gallen.[52]  
  The first club founded within the present-day borders of Turkey was Panionios, founded in the city of Izmir in 1890. Being the club of the Greek community, it relocated to modern day Greece in 1922 after the population exchange between Greece and Turkey. The first Turkish sports club ever is Besiktas J.K. founded in 1903. Besiktas established their football branch in 1911. The first registered football club in the country was Galatasaray, founded in 1905.  
  CDJ Oran was founded in 1894. It is the oldest club in Algeria and Maghreb.[citation needed]  
  Moghreb Tétouan was founded in 1922. It is the oldest club in Morocco. Moghreb Tétouan took part in Spanish Liga for 33 years until Morocco's independence was achieved in 1956.[citation needed]  
  In India, some of the oldest clubs are Calcutta Football Club (founded in 1872, later merged with Calcutta Cricket Club founded in 1792 to form Calcutta Cricket and Football Club), Sarada FC, Aryan FC (1884), Sovabazar FC (1886), Mohun Bagan (1889), Mohammedan SC (1891), and East Bengal (1920). All of these clubs are from Kolkata.[53]  
  The oldest football club in Indonesia is Gymnastiek Vereeniging, founded in the City of Medan in 1887.[54]  
  The oldest still active football club in Indonesia is UMS 1905, founded in 1905, currently competing in Liga 3 Jakarta. Several local clubs in the 1900s during the Dutch East Indies era that entered into internal teams such as Hercules, Vios Batavia (Persija internal); Sidolig, UNI Bandung (Persib internal) and others.  
  Although football variants have been played in North America since the 1820s, the claim of oldest continuous football club in North America is still a matter of debate.  
  Oneida Football Club of Boston, Massachusetts, established in 1862, was the first organised team to play any kind of football in the United States. The game played by the club, known as the "Boston game", was an informal local variant that predated the codification of rules for either association or American football. The team, which consisted of graduates of Boston's elite preparatory schools, played on Boston Common from 1862 to 1865, during which time they reportedly never lost a game or even gave up a single point.[56][57]  
  In terms of gridiron football, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League can trace their roots back to the Hamilton Football Club (nicknamed the Tigers) which formed in 1869, then later merged with the Hamilton Wildcats in 1950 to form the current franchise. Their rivals to the east, the Toronto Argonauts, were founded four years later, in 1873, and have a mostly unchanged franchise history. Both clubs began as rugby football clubs and only later adapted to the gridiron-style of play which would become known as Canadian football. The oldest continuous rugby club in North America which still plays rugby is the McGill University Rugby Football Club, which was established in 1863, although their first recorded game was not until 1865.[58] The oldest independent (non-university) rugby club is the Westmount Rugby Club of Montreal, which formed in 1876.[59]  
  In the United States, gridiron-based variants of the game did not distinguish themselves from existing codes until 1871, when Harvard University began playing the Boston Game invented by Oneida. Its rules allowed a player to pick up the ball and run with it if he were chased and it quickly spread, with innovations added by Yale University student Walter Camp. The oldest existing non-university semiprofessional football club is the Watertown Red & Black, which was founded in 1896.

  News'One of the best in Liverpool history' – Fernando Torres' pride in Mo Salah  
  Fernando Torres has revealed his pride at seeing Mohamed Salah establish himself as ‘one of the best players of the last 10 years’ and among the greatest ever at Liverpool.  
  Torres and Salah were once teammates at Chelsea as the latter made his first steps in English football back in 2014, and have remained in touch since.  
  Like most people, Torres has been blown away by the levels Salah has reached following his move to Anfield in 2017.  
  With 207 goals in 337 appearances, the Egyptian currently sits fifth on the Reds’ all-time top scorers list and has a games-to-goals ratio that surpasses many of the club’s great forwards – Torres included.  
  “We were teammates at Chelsea and I’m really, really happy for him,” Torres told Liverpoolfc.com. “I’m in touch with him many times and I’m really happy that he breaks all my records!  
  “I remember when he came to England and he was very young and didn’t have the minutes he deserved. He had to move to Italy and prove himself and find a special club for a special player.  
  “You can see the results of what he did by himself. For me, [he is a] top player and one of the best players in the last 10 years. I always say this, [he is] my favourite player [and] I put him among the best players in the world in the last 10 years.  
  “You can see what Liverpool managed to win and you know the club is fighting for everything and I’m sure he is one of the main reasons. I’m really proud of him because I know how difficult it was for him to come to England and time proved he was a special player and just needed a special club like Liverpool to trust him, and he showed what he can do.  
  “I was really happy when he signed his new contract to keep playing for Liverpool [in 2022]. He’s going to be one of the best players in Liverpool history, I’m sure. He is already but still he has many things to do.”  
  Torres has also played alongside another member of Jürgen Klopp’s current Reds squad, briefly linking up with a young Diogo Jota during his second spell at Atletico Madrid in 2016.  
  “I remember when Diogo came,” Torres said. “He was really young and came from Pacos de Ferreira as one of these young talents who joined the pre-season in Atletico’s first team and everybody is expecting big things from them.  
  “At the end of the pre-season he left [for FC Porto] but you could see something special in this young lad. I’m really happy for him, how he’s doing now in his time in England.  
  “Moving to Liverpool was a big step for him. Now you can see the kind of player he is. I remember that small period of time we played together and I’m so proud of what he did after that because it’s not easy to come to Atletico and leave on loan, and you have to prove yourself in different places.”  
  Torres made an emotional return to Anfield last weekend, scoring in front of the Kop as Liverpool FC Legends defeated Ajax Legends 4-2 in the eighth annual charity game, raising money for LFC Foundation.

  The 40-year-old, who netted 81 goals in 142 appearances for the Reds between 2007 and 2011, is currently embarking on a new career in coaching.  
  Torres manages Atletico’s U19 team and hopes one day to emulate some of his former coaches, such as Rafael Benitez and Diego Simeone.  
  He also, of course, has a lot of respect for the work of Klopp.  
  “I like more the English style – the transition game and the press and to play quick and sharp,” he said. “That’s why I’m a big fan of Jürgen since he was in Dortmund.  
  “I was really happy when I saw him signing for Liverpool because you could see from Klopp [that] there is a connection with the supporters – he did it in Mainz in Germany, he did it in Dortmund and Liverpool is even more special. The connection from the players, the coaches and the supporters is amazing. You can see after nine seasons what he did and I think he’s special.  
  “I met him a few times when they came to Madrid and I also follow Pep Lijnders. I read his book and I can see many things they do daily and it’s a big inspiration. Hopefully I have the chance to meet them and to talk with them and see what they are doing.  
  “When you see a Jürgen Klopp team, you know the way they are going to perform. There is one style – this heavy-metal football – and I love that. The difficult thing is: how do you train that? Hopefully I can find out one day.”  
  Torres says he has also been delighted to see the progress of so many young players at Liverpool this season – some of whom he came across earlier in their journey.  
  “I remember playing against Liverpool in the [UEFA] Youth League three years ago,” he added. “In that squad I played against [Jarell] Quansah, [Bobby] Clark, [Conor] Bradley, many of the players that you can see now in the first team.  
  “It’s really nice to see the players when they were young and now they are in the first team and doing the job they are doing. It’s really nice for the coaches to be part of that.”  
  He continued: “I was one of those players that said I will never be a coach! But look at me now, I’m trying!  
  “I’m enjoying a lot, learning a lot in the Atletico Madrid academy. It’s my third season in the U19s and I feel that I can help young players because I was there once and I’m trying to help them.  
  “You can see now that we have Pablo Barrios in the first team of Atletico – he was with us two years ago and I’m really proud of him. You can feel that you are part of the development of the players. This is really nice.  
  “I’m trying to find my own way but always looking at the best. I’m lucky enough to have fantastic managers in my career – Rafael Benitez, Luis Aragones in Spain, [Jose] Mourinho, [Carlo] Ancelotti, Simeone. I learn a lot from each of them and now I try to do things my own way.”  
  Roméo Lavia’s Chelsea season over after one 32-minute appearance  
  Thigh injury rules out midfielder for rest of campaign  
  He has not played since December debut after £53m move  
  Roméo Lavia, who has played 32 minutes of competitive football since joining Chelsea for £53m in August, has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a thigh injury.  
  The update on the Belgium midfielder is the latest in a long line of worrying developments for ­Mauricio Pochettino, who has had to cope without a number of key players at various points of a ­testing campaign. Reece James, Chelsea’s captain, has not played since December and ­Christopher Nkunku, Lesley ­Ugochukwu, Levi Colwill and ­Wesley Fofana are also in the treatment room.  
  Injuries have made it hard for Pochettino to rotate and his options in midfield will be limited by Lavia’s absence. The 20-year-old, who has endured a frustrating campaign since joining from Southampton, has not played since injuring a thigh against Crystal Palace on 27 ­December. Tests have shown he has had a ­setback in his recovery.  
  Lavia had spent four months out with an ankle injury before ­making a belated debut after Chelsea beat Liverpool to his signature.  
  Pochettino, whose side host Burnley in the league on Saturday, has had to rely on Conor Gallagher, Enzo Fernández and Moisés Caicedo in midfield. He has been boosted by Carney Chukwuemeka’s return from a knee injury.  
  Chelsea have struggled with injuries since being bought two years ago by Todd ­Boehly and Clearlake ­Capital. The owners have overhauled the medical department and are ­looking for a new head of per­formance medicine.  
  Chelsea suffer new crushing blow as club confirm extent of Romeo Lavia injury  
  Romeo Lavia joined Chelsea at the end of the summer transfer window, but injury serbacks have meant the former Southampton star has endured a tough first season  
  Romeo Lavia has struggled with injuries since joining Chelsea (  
  Chelsea midfielder Romeo Lavia will miss the remainder of the season, capping off a nightmare first year in West London.  
  Lavia, who came thoguh Manchester City's academy, joined the Blues in August after suffering relegation from the Premier League with Southampton. He was made to wait for his debut due to injury, though, before suffering further issues after finally making it onto the pitch in December.  
  "Midfielder Romeo Lavia is to unfortunately miss the remainder of our 2023-24 campaign following a setback in his recovery," a club statement read. "Recent medical assessments have confirmed that Lavia, who sustained a significant thigh injury against Crystal Palace back in December, will not feature again this season."  
  The update would also appear to end any hopes Lavia might have had of playing at Euro 2024 with Belgium. The 20-year-old made his senior international debut in March 2023, but has not added to his one cap against Germany.  
  Lavia was an unused substitute for Southampton's first game of the season, joining Chelsea soon after. The £58m man's Blues debut was delayed after he picked up an injury in training, though, and he only returned to the matchday squad on Christmas Eve.  
  He remained on the bench for the match against Wolves, but played half an hour against Palace three days later. Sadly for him, though, that will prove to be his only outing of the season.  
  How big a miss will Romeo Lavia be for Chelsea? Have your say in the comments section

  Chelsea sit 11th in the Premier League with 11 games remaining, though the teams above them have fewer matches to play, They're also into the semi-finals of the FA Cup after beating Championship high-flyers Leicester, with manager Mauricio Pochettino speaking out after he was booed by sections of the crowd.  
  "I completely understand the situation but that doesn’t mean that we agree," he said. "They need to trust me to manage in the way I think is the best way for the club. I know really well how to manage.”  
  Chelsea are back in action on Saturday, hosting Burnley in the Premier League as they look to return to the top half. Games against Manchester United, Sheffield United and Everton will follow that encounter, before an FA Cup semi against Manchester City on April 20.

  Chelsea's Strasbourg project threatens to turn sour as angry fans protest over some familiar problems  
  French club at real risk of relegation from Ligue 1  
  Stamford Bridge is not the only place where Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali are coming under fire.  
  Antagonism towards Boehly and Eghbali in France comes amid poor results, criticism of their youth-first transfer strategy and fury among fans about a lack of communication from the owners. Sound familiar?  
  Chelsea fans have warned of organised protest, and at Strasbourg there is already revolt among supporters, who will hold a protest march before their game against Rennes on Sunday.  
  “Racing is now nothing more than a financial asset, owned by an investment fund that already owns another club,” said Ultra Boys 90 in a statement this month. “Multi-club is killing football, and we’ll fight it!  
  “Two transfer windows have also come and gone, and all we can do is watch helplessly as our club is stripped of all its experienced players in favour of young, up-and-coming players. We’re not fooled! No professional club can be competitive under these conditions. That’s why we’re asking: what is BlueCo’s real plan for Racing?”  
  The feeling among Strasbourg fans is that BlueCo is using Strasbourg to boost its primary asset, Chelsea.  
  Boehly has said they want to create pathways for young players to make it at Chelsea by giving them game time in a competitive European league.  
  The feeling among Strasbourg fans is that BlueCo is using Strasbourg to boost its primary asset  
  There was opposition from Strasbourg fans from the start, and resentment has grown. The team from the Alsace region have been dragged into a relegation battle in Ligue 1 after a run of just two wins in nine games this year under manager Patrick Vieira.  
  They are just four points above the relegation zone and face a battle to avoid dropping down to Ligue 2.  
  Goalkeeper Matz Sels, comfortably Strasbourg’s most experienced regular starter, was sold to Nottingham Forest on deadline day in February and replaced by a 22-year-old who had never played in Ligue 1.  
  When Vieira wanted reinforcements in January, BlueCo sent Andre Santos on loan from Chelsea after he struggled to get a look-in at Forest. They also signed 18-year-old Serbian striker Milos Lukovic, another player for the future, who was immediately loaned back to IMT Belgrade.  
  Vieira wanted a winger, but BlueCo’s failure to sign a wide player was blamed on its desire for 19-year-old on-loan Chelsea youngster Angelo Gabriel to play every week.  
  That is just one sign that the relationship is not working well for Strasbourg.  
  Chelsea sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart are just as influential as Strasbourg head of recruitment Loic Desire.  
  Vieira joined club president Marc Keller and four senior players when meeting Ultra Boys 90 last Thursday in a bid to help calm tensions. Their efforts were appreciated, but Ultra Boys 90 continues to demand a meeting with BlueCo, particularly Eghbali.  
  He is the most involved in the football operations at both clubs but has attended just two Strasbourg matches this season.  
  Keller insisted in a recent interview with L’Equipe that Chelsea are more like a “brother” and “not above, but next to us”, but suspicion among Strasbourg fans is rife.  
  Troyes were relegated from Ligue 1 last season, three years after they were taken over by Manchester City’s City Football Group.  
  With the protest planned this weekend, Boehly and Eghbali are getting it in the neck from the King’s Road to the Rhine Valley.  
  Tottenham vs Chelsea: The wildest game in Premier League history?  
  Ever seen anything like it? In one of the Premier League's most bonkers games, there were five goals, another five chalked off, two red cards, the potential for several more, nine VAR checks... And, eventually, three points for Chelsea in a 4-1 win at Tottenham

  FREE TO WATCH: Highlights from the Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea  
  Nine-player Spurs' 4-1 loss to Chelsea had everything - goals, red cards, controversy, aggro, offsides and moments of class in one of the Premier League's wildest games.  
  Though five goals were scored at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, that barely told half the story with another five ruled out by VAR, as well as those two red cards - not to mention there could have been several more - and nine VAR checks across an unforgettable 90 minutes.  
  Or closer to 110 when you include the added time it all racked up too.

  18 mins: Udogie yellow carded for two-footed tackle  
  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  
  VAR sticks with yellow for Udogie after lunging tackle on Sterling  
  INCIDENT: Destiny Udogie is yellow carded for a rash challenge on Raheem Sterling.  
  Gary Neville: "He gets the ball but it looks like a classic two-footed tackle. It looks like a classic red card. It's the challenge footballers hate.  
  "He's a lucky boy because that is a challenge that is universally hated. He would have snapped Sterling's leg had the Chelsea player not pulled it away."  
  Jamie Carragher: "Very close to being dangerous. The difference between reckless and dangerous is whether there's impact."  
  Also See:  
  Daniel Sturridge: "Intent was to go for the ball. It looked like a nasty challenge. He didn't make any connection so I think the decision not to send him off is correct."  
  Ange Postecoglu: "I didn't think there was anything in that tackle that was anything worse than a few others I saw. It went unpunished but that's the nature of these kind of games, some will get punished, some won't. I don't think that was the trigger for what went after that."

  Raheem Sterling goal disallowed for handball after VAR review  
  INCIDENT: Cristian Romero kicks out at Levi Colwill off the ball in the build-up to Sterling's goal. Sterling drives into the box and shoots at goal, the ball hits Pedro Porro and then the hand of the Chelsea winger, before going on to score. Goal is later disallowed for handball.  
  Gary Neville: "Romero is a lucky boy."  
  Jamie Carragher: "I agree [it was petulant not violent]. He's stupid at times. It's daft but I don't think it's a red card."

  Cole Palmer scores from spot after chaos as goal disallowed and Romero sent off!  
  INCIDENT: Moises Caicedo scores from outside the box but goal disallowed with Nicolas Jackson in Guglielmo Vicario's eyeline while standing in an offside position. Romero then sent off after VAR review for tackle on Enzo Fernandez in the build-up to the goal. Cole Palmer scores from resulting penalty.  
  Gary Neville: "It's a mad challenge by Romero. For me, it's a penalty. It's not a natural follow through. It's definitely a penalty but for me. He could have gone earlier [Colwill incident]. They showed a replay on screen and the fans were not happy."  
  Jamie Carragher: "Absolutely ridiculous to put a challenge in like that in the box. He was out of control, excessive force, definite red card! There's so much I admire about him but he's got to cut that out from his game.  
  Ange Postecoglu: "They had a good look at it and gave it so I have to accept it. The red card affected the game, I felt like I was standing around waiting for things to happen most of the game, with VAR intervention. It felt like a lot of standing around."  
  Daniel Sturridge: "The goal should have stood in the first place! I don't think Jackson is in his eyeline!"

  Dejan Kulusevski's deflected effort gives Spurs an early lead against Chelsea  
  Heung-Min Son was given offside by VAR shortly after:  
  Micky van de Ven hobbled off badly with an apparent hamstring injury, while James Maddison was substituted after hurting his ankle unchallenged.  
  Colwill tangled with Pape Sarr and Emerson Royal in added time as tempered continued to fray, with Royal arguably saving the Chelsea defender from a potential dismissal by holding him off. "They should have let him go for it and get himself sent off," Sky Sports' Gary Neville said on commentary.  
  On the stroke of half-time, Reece James struck Udogie with his elbow during an aerial challenge. Neville added: "Reece James knows. What is Reece James doing? What are Chelsea doing?"

  Spurs down to nine after Udogie shown second yellow  
  INCIDENT: Having survived a VAR check during the first half for his two-footed tackle, Udogie is dismissed just before the hour mark for a second bookable offence when he brings down Sterling.  
  Peter Drury: "Having shown so much bravery one man light, goodness knows what the gameplan is now they're two down."  
  Gary Neville: "It's just stupid from Udogie. Postecoglou won't believe the madness that he is watching from his own eyes. He knows he's on a booking, Sterling's going away from goal and wide."  
  56 mins: Jackson misses sitter  
  INCIDENT: With Spurs still at sixes and sevens in the wake of Udogie's dismissal, Jackson is given the freedom of London at the free-kick that follows to nod James' cross past Vicario - but his weak header is cleared off the line by Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg when he simply had to score.  
  Gary Neville: "How has he missed that? He's sort of headed it into the ground. It was such a simple chance, what's he doing? That's really poor from Jackson, You have to score, simple as that."  
  Peter Drury: "Not much of what is happening here is making sense."  
  Continuously: Spurs' incredible high line - 'it's a back seven!'

  Jamie Carragher and Daniel Sturridge analyse the high defensive line Tottenham persisted with after going down to nine men and what this meant for the Chelsea forwards  
  INCIDENT: Despite going down to nine men, Tottenham continued to look to catch Chelsea out with a high line, which would ultimately cost them three goals on the counter attack scored by Jackson.  
  Jamie Carragher: "You see lots of teams do this, Liverpool or Aston Villa. But they didn't do it at Tottenham with nine men. It's a back seven! You've only got nine men. You never play against a line like that."  
  Daniel Sturridge: "There was a lot of space there, and Chelsea were trying to work out how to break it down. As players, you have to be patient to play against it to find the perfect pass."

  75 mins: Jackson finally gives Chelsea lead  
  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  
  Jackson scores as Chelsea finally make breakthrough!  
  INCIDENT: Having denied Chelsea four times since half-time, Vicario is finally beaten as the Blues break through Spurs' offside trap. Sterling finds James whose low cross is pinpoint for Jackson to sweep home.  
  Peter Drury: "Chelsea laboured against nine - but in the event, Spurs could not turn back the tide eternally."  
  Gary Neville: "It's the first time Chelsea have played a few passes in and around that halfway line, shown some patience and composure. And once they did, it drew them out and became natural when to play it in behind."  
  78, 86, 90+4 mins: Spurs go close to snatching unlikely equaliser  
  INCIDENT: Despite their significant numerical disadvantage, Tottenham keep pushing against the odds at 2-1 down - and even think they've found an equaliser at one stage.  
  Eric Dier's super volley from a free-kick after 78 minutes sends the stadium into momentary delirium until an offside flag is backed up by VAR to deny him the most unlikely of levellers.  
  Gary Neville: "It wasn't off at the first one, I was watching him go round the back. It must be from the flick-on."  
  Peter Drury: "That was a sumptuous finish anyway."  
  INCIDENT: After Malo Gusto gives away a silly free-kick, Rodrigo Bentancur is then inches away from meeting Pedro Porro's cross but even at full stretch, cannot quite make any connection to force the ball past Robert Sanchez.  
  Gary Neville: "It's in between a header and a shot with his foot. What a chance. Gusto nearly paid a heavy price."  
  INCIDENT: Oliver Skipp feeds Heung-Min Son on the counter-attack before the Tottenham captain sidesteps Axel Disasi, but on his left foot drags an effort which is easy enough for Sanchez to keep out.  
  Gary Neville: "What an effort this is from Spurs. They're still getting chances, and good chances - Son looks to the heavens and thinks I should have put it in the bottom corner."  
  What else happened as Chelsea finally, finally sealed victory?

  Vicario makes big stop after Cucurella breaks through high Spurs line  
  Take a bow Vicario. The big Italian has been making a name for himself in the Premier League since he arrived, but few keepers would emerge with such acclaim after shipping four goals to one of their biggest rivals.  
  The 27-year-old was at his best to deny Jackson and Cole Palmer in a huge double save just after half-time, before clawing another ball away from Jackson and making an excellent stop with his legs from Marc Cucurella.

  Jackson rounds keeper to complete hat-trick!  
  But he was left horribly, inevitably exposed as Chelsea finally played their way through Spurs' high line to allow Jackson to net a 22-minute hat-trick, with the forward's second and third goals in added time.  
  Carra: Box office MNF proves PL is best in the world!  
  Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher:  
  "I've been watching football for almost 40 years and certainly as a neutral, I would say that was one of the most enjoyable games I've seen for so many different reasons.  
  "It was absolutely box office and that is why the Premier League is the best league in the world by a country mile!"

  Share All sharing options for: The Chelsea ‘Fan Advisory Board’ speaks!  
  The seven-member (7) Fan Advisory Board (FAB) have issued a public response to the thousand-member-strong Chelsea Supporters Trust (including yours truly, full disclosure), and have proclaimed that it is indeed they who have the more sensitive finger on the pulse of the fanbase. Or some such.  
  Frankly, this is all a bit silly, and it’s getting played up by headlines of a “civil war” among Chelsea fans.  
  That sort of discord may or may not be true, but it’s all just opinions in the end. And the mob is fickle. Always.  
  The CST claim the fans are unhappy and restless and, most importantly, that the club and especially our decision-makers aren’t engaging enough with the wider fanbase. And, for me, it’s that latter part that’s the actual crucial bit, and that’s getting lost in this budding pissing contest. (I wasn’t a fan of the overly melodramatic CST statement either.)  
  The FAB, the exclusive group of fans selected by the club — important detail! — claim that the club’s doing plenty of engaging. Of course, the club’s only really engaging with them (supposedly), and they’re not exactly engaging proactively with the rest. (“You can call us anytime” is an hilariously weak defense; while not even the frequency of Fans’ Forums has increased.)  
  But hey, at least the CST got the FAB talking publicly (sort of) for the first time ever, so ... progress?  
  “We don’t recognise the suggestion that fans are not being involved in the future of the club. This goes directly against our experience. So we wanted to set the record straight.  
  “Supporters are able to contact the FAB board members directly via the club website and the FAB hold regular in-person drop-in sessions at Stamford Bridge.  
  “At the last main board meeting (on March 11th), Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali directly (and in person) asked the FAB to help shape the club’s proposals in relation to ticketing and we have been working on exactly that.  
  “We have had multiple sessions with club executives to work through potential proposals and provided with data to help substantiate any potential changes.  
  “The idea that fans are not involved and not at a decision-making level, could not be further from the truth.  
  “The club is aware that, while the FAB is constructive and understands the realities, we are also challenging. We make our views known forcefully. We achieve real change. We work and will continue to work on the relationship.  
  “Significantly more resources have been allocated to fan liaison than at any point in the club’s history.  
  “Finally, we would like to add this. Chelsea’s men’s team is part way through a season with much to play for. We will soon return to Wembley. We want to rise up the table, with the European places in touching distance.  
  “We have exciting young players with real green shoots of improvement in the men’s first team following significant investment. In addition, our women’s team continues to thrive domestically and on the European stage in Emma Hayes’ final season.  
  “Football is a matter of opinion and expressing emotion is part of that. But we have to get behind our team and make our contribution to victory rather than seek chaos and division through attacks and campaigns.  
  “Every Chelsea fan (including the ownership group) is frustrated at setbacks or results that don’t go our way. But the team and the club more broadly needs its supporters.  
  “The only people who benefit from Chelsea fans turning on Chelsea are fans of other clubs. If we’re pulling in the same direction then ‘every little thing’s gonna be alright’.”

  Trophy History  
  Chelsea’s trophy history is revered as one of the most successful clubs in England. There are Premier League, cup and Champions League titles on the list of how many the club has won.  
  The Stamford Bridge outfit have been among the dominant forces in England in the Premier League era. Chelsea have regularly added to their trophy cabinet and also reached the top in Europe twice. While just Arsenal and Manchester United can rival their record in the FA Cup.  
  Glory in the English Football League Cup (EFL Cup) has also come Chelsea’s way throughout its history. So, in case you ever need reminding, The Chelsea Chronicle has compiled a list of every major trophy that the west Londoners have won throughout Chelsea’s history so far…  
  Chelsea have won the top-flight trophy five times  
  The Premier League era has seen Chelsea establish themselves as one of England’s trophy-winning forces. Before the start of the breakaway division in 1992, the Blues had only won the top-flight title once. But Chelsea have brought five Premier League titles to west London.  
  Chelsea added their first Premier League title to their list of trophies under Jose Mourinho in 2004/05. The Blues put to good use the lumps of cash that Roman Abramovich invested. While Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti and Antonio Conte have since overseen more recent titles.  
  List of Chelsea’s top-flight trophies:  
  2005/06  
  2009/10  
  With the Premier League titles in Chelsea’s trophy cabinet, the Blues have won the second-tier in their history. The Stamford Bridge side last played outside of the top-flight in 1988/89.  
  List of Chelsea’s second-tier trophies:
