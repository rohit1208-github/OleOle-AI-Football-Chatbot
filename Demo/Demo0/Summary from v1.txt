Manchester United has won the FA Community Shield in 14 times and claimed the crown in 12 different trophies: UEFA Super Cup, UEFA Europa League and Intercontinental Champions League. Following the 2010/11 season, the club has always taken part in the United Supporters' Trust of the English Premier League. A statement on its website states: "Since inception in 1992 as the football club has developed its First Division and has become one of the most successful soccer clubs in the world, United is recognised by supporters as a leader in our sports. This club's history dates from the club's inception, when Louis van Gaal was appointed as United executive manager by the Football Association in 1997, we knew that the club would succeed and was determined to become more successful than ever." In 2003, United became the first English team to win the First Division, becoming a founding member of a consortium with the Football Association (FA) and the Football Supporters League (FCFL).

In 2005, Manchester United became the first English team to win the UEFA First Division, becoming the first team to complete the FIFA Club World Cup in 2008, the first time a team in the First Division to win the First Division in the first decade of the current century.[38] The club is the world's most successful football club, having won the FA Cup five times, the 2005 UEFA Europa League each, the 2005 UEFA European Cup in UEFA Europa League and the eventual UEFA Champions League in the 2005–06 season, a record which would go until 2008.[39] In December 2011, Real Madrid won the UEFA Europa League for the first time, one year after its first competitive victory in the competition.[40][41] Under the ownership of José Mourinho, who is the club's owner, they won the League for just the fourth time in a row – the club's first top cup game of the century–and it became the club's first time of the First Division with an away victory since 1987.

In June 2011, Manchester United became the first English team to win the Premier League – and the first victory to do that would win the second – with a remarkable achievement by Paul McCartney, Bobby Charlton and Ryan Giggs in the Second Division.[42] Manchester United finished second in the First Division, with 14 wins over Nottingham Forest and 11 losses against Southampton, Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest. In January 2012, they reached the FA Cup final, beating Man City 1–0 after beating Manchester United 2–1 in a thrilling 19–17 home victory against Inter Milan, the club's first victory against the competition since 1990.

The club lost two in total to Aston Villa in the Europa League, having drawn two times against Cardiff City and two against Blackburn Rovers. They won a trophy in December 2015 and a trophy in October 2017, with two in 20 matches against Southampton. They were beaten by Manchester City by a combined score of 13–17 in the second round of the FA Cup – a record that would remain until 2021.

Manchester United has failed 15 of 25 home and away games since 1999-03, failing to win the FA Cup in 2006. On 7 December 2013, the club failed to reach the Football League Cup Winners' Cup final for the first time since the 2003–04 season. On July 8, 2007 Manchester United overtook Manchester United for the next day to qualify as the FA Cup Winners' Cup, with a total of 30 trophies.[43]

United has also been part of major transfers – and signings – through the 2013–14 season:

Transfer revenue
Manchester United became the first English team to become the first English team to receive the highest transfer fee in the English Football League. The club was granted a £3.5 mn transfer fee by the Football Association in order to reach a potential £115m transfer fee for Matt Busby, but could not come close enough to pay the £500,000 per day fee offered by Red Devils to achieve the highest transfer fee in the European League.

Liverpool were granted a second transfer fee on 30 December 2014 – a deal that was initially £30 mn – that is not covered by their transfer fees. Manchester United was granted a transfer fee of £40.1 million after
